Granted there is more work in organic farming, I believe that it is the better option. There is a larger start up fee in organic farming but in the long run it leaves you with healthier soil which over time will be more beneficial with the growing process, and better tasting more nutritious products.
non-animal source greenhouse gas emissions runoff in water methane fueling transportation  meat option its easier
try to eat less meat and dairy products 
that they should think more about the world , and issues that effect them.
Plant-based protein sources offer many benefits over even the most sustainable animal sources of protein. A concept in biology is the idea of energy levels, being that only 1/10th of the energy in one levels such as plants move up to the next level such as cows and other livestock. The energy level in cows in particular is only 1/10th of that in the entire energy level in plants used to feed them. Sources of protein such as beans and tofu are for more environmentally sustainable, which is my primary concern.
I would tell my friends to choose the organic route of eating because of the torture, slaughter, and other unhealthy things done to animals before their meat is processed and served to us. 
meatless option is better for the environment is cruelty free is heathier for your body 1 the meat option it is second nature
Meatless option limits greenhouse gases limits runoff reduces methane production 1 to eat meat it provides an easy source of protein
The best option is going organic because it maintains biodiversity. It also uses less pesticides and hardly an chemicals.
meat option allows us to use new technologies methane fueling transportation create innovative solutions the meatless option greenhouse gas emisssions
What is organic farming? Biology for all. throughout the video, the message holds a strong foundation as to why the increase of human population on this planet should sort to produce more organic food and to decrease the disease that comes from the soil. For instance, the video does mention the importance of crop rotation. It says that crop rotation is used to reduce diseases building up in the soils an to strengthen the soil composition. 
I believe I would tell my friends that organic farming is the best option. Although the videos poked holes in some of the topics within organic farming such as the use of pesticides, I still believe organic farming is the safer option. For starters, even if organic farming does use pesticides, the risk of developing illness is much lower than conventional. Pesticides have been linked to cancers and putting the best possible ingredients in your body is my belief, as I am studying to be a nurse. I also think in terms of livestock, it is extremely important to pick organic meats as conventional slaughter houses are known to be in horrendous conditions and the quality of meat is very low. 
I would tell a friend that organic farming is the best option because it is more sustainable. Organic farming does not use pesticides and is natural. The only issue is that farmers do not know what nutrients are in some compost and manure and how these nutrients will benefit their crops. Organic farming is less harmful for the environment because chemicals are not used.
Organic foods because they have no chemicals, less pesticides and they maintain biodiversity. 
going organic because it is less harmful for the environment
meatless option is better for animals  people the environment 1 the meat option meat tastes good and has a lot of health benefits
To eat organic farm fresh foods instead of big corporation foods that have slaughterhouses etc. By doing this it will reduce our carbon footprint, be more animal friendly
I would tell my friends that I would eat organic, but I wouldn't want to pay the costs. If the roommate that wants to eat organic has the money to pay for it herself, then go for it. However, being in college I do not have the kind of money to be spending extra on organic foods.
I would tell them the second one because it seems to have all the pros and cons and it could answer all potential questions. 
I think it really depends on what products they are buying. in some instances buying organic makes better sense and others it does not.
I think the choice of recycling the cow manure into reusable fuel for vehicles is the better option.  Not only are we keeping up with beef and dairy production which will sustain the growing populations, but the reusable gas from the cow manure is a very viable source of clean energy for future automobile development.
I would tell my friends who all eat meat regularly to try and do a meatless day throughout the week to start.  I would inform them about the meat market, the large amounts of resources needed, environmental problems it causes, animal cruelty, etc.  Giving them information about this topic would allow them to be aware of the cons of the meat market and maybe even limiting the amount of meat they consume.  
I'm still undecided 
To eat healthy natural food to prolong a healthy life
I would tell my friends that eating organic is the most sustainable and healthiest option, even if it means spending a few extra dollars on groceries each week. 
I would say that It is healthier to buy organic foods, however it is more expensive and is a luxury that our world may not be able to produce for everyone in the world.
I would tell my friends the best option is organic because it is better and more sustainable for both the earth and people.
I would tell them that organic is the best decision because it leaves out so many harmful chemicals that can negatively effect your body.
To me there is a good and bad to everything so I would just tell them what I think is the best option and let them choose for themselves. 
I would say that inorganic foods are the best option because they are less expensive (college students are broke). If you look at the bigger picture, it is harmful to the environment. 
meat option is able to counteract pollution from the cows produce methane use the methane to fuel transportation 1 the meatless option it would cut the problem at the root
 I would tell them to make whatever choice makes them feel comfortable financially and morally. 
I think that the second option is the best option. By using the manure to create a source of methane is ecofriendly. In addition, the cows are still eating crops that are good for them because it is a continuous cycle. 
I think the best option is to cut out sugared foods and limit meat consumption
meat option it's a great source of protein can produce methane fueling transportation technologies can counteract pollution 1 meatless option some farms do not have the advanced technology to reduce pollution
I would tell my friends that it is best to buy from organic foods because they have less cancer casing pestisides
To not eat caged meat.
Organic because it healthier to eat foods with less chemicals.
Conventional because I cannot be a hypocrite and it is easier. 
I would tell my friends that choosing organic would be the best decision because it is much healthier for you - there as less chemical used in the process, less pesticides, and it is supporting our local farmers. 
Conventional food is the best option right now because organic food has lower yields, is less efficient, and is more expensive. The world just can't afford the luxury these days.
I would tell my friend to eat green, because if the average american actually does eat 3 burgers a week, that is scary, especially because of that rate, we have to feed cows corn which they are not even meant to be eating. 
not sure  is neutral and non-biased believe 1 meatless or meat theyalso make sense
I would choose organic foods because they are better for you due to the fact that they have less pesticides and less chemicals used.
After careful consideration, I would tell my friends about sustainable farming as the best option. Throughout the video, it is seen that they put all the products being produced to good use so that there is minimal waste. They use the milk that is produced to make ice cream on the farm and also sell to manufactures. They also take the manure produced by the cows, and turn it into usable gas to fuel, trucks, planes, and the equipment on the farm as well. The leftover manure from the gas production process is put right back into the soil on the farm as fertilizer. Sustainable farming can be described as using farming techniques to preserve and protect the environment, public health, human conservation, animal welfare. This is exactly what the farm shown in the video was doing. They grow the crops from the manure, the crops are used to feed the cows, which produce milk , manure, and methane gas, which in turn go back to growing crops; in a efficient cycle of farming. This is not only good for the environment because of the minimal waste being produced, but as seen in the video, is also an entertaining place to take your family. 
If my friends ask me what is the cheaper option I will tell them conventional. If my friends ask me what is the healthier option I will tell them organic. Personally, I think the better option would be organic because the fact that it has less chemicals and hormones. But as a broke college student I will pick conventional because it's cheaper and there is a wider variety on options.
I would tell my friends about video two because it shows how organic products are good and bad.  This allows people not to choose sides and also gives good information on how not every organic product is fully 100% organic. 
I would tell them to choose organic farming because it has many positives, and they seem to outweigh the negatives.
It would depend on why we are watching the videos. If it was for a class such as digestion or about pollution/methane production then I would chose the first video as it is more factual. If it was for self education, I would watch the second as it is a more interesting piece and not as dry. 
I believe that the second video would be optimal in reducing the amount of methane released into the atmosphere. In fact, I believe that it would do way more in the long run. Everybody cutting back a burger a week will certainly help, but you can't really monitor that. If more farms followed suit and emphasized sustainability it would have a larger impact than the first option. I think if Borden and a few other large scale dairy companies really pushed sustainability it would have a huge impact on the amount of methane being produced.
I would tell my friends that organic farming is still the best option because when you take a closer look at each farming technique, conventional farming has far more cons than does organic farming. Yes, organic farming may produce more methane and yield lower crop yields, but conventional farming will require more land use causing us to tear down more of our forest which can, in turn, be  more detrimental to our environment. 
I would tell my friends to be aware of what you are eating, not necessarily to go 100% organic or conventional. 
Meat option Good Delicious Amazing 1 Meatless option it is healthier
I think that eating local meat is best since there is less environmental impact. When you don't have to transport the animal long distances it helps to reduce carbon emissions. 
I would tell my friends that while conventional farming is better for the population and sustaining food production for the upcoming years, organic farming has better results of living which can eliminate so many obstacles we face today such as illnesses from conventional pesticides, food poisoning, and other toxicity issues we encounter in America.
I would tell a friend to withstand from eating meat at least once a week because to have healthy animals like cows there are consequences. There are issues such as runoff water, fueling transportation, and pollution.
I don't know, both have their pros and cons. Depends on the friend. If their more environmentally conscious, go organic. If they don't want to spend a lot, use conventional foods.
I would tell people that organic farming is the best because it is healthier for the earth, but also produces healthier food since there are no pesticides.


Organic foods are good as they contain less pesticides and are usually locally grown. 
The best option would be to eat organically because although it may be a little more expensive and harder to find, it is healthier for the body and does not contain hazardous chemicals and pesticides. 
animal source methane production methane fueling transportation creating innovative solutions the meatless option it reduces greenhouse gas emissions
Organic, because it is healthier for you and will help the environment


I would tell my friends that the best option is organic because it is the healthier alternative to conventional, if you are willing to spend the extra money.
Organic food production is a sustainable and environmentally friendly option. When consuming organic foods, we can be assured that in production there was no use of fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, or hormones. Instead, methods are used such as biological pest management, composting, manure applications, and crop rotations. These methods also promote the use of a sustainable agriculture system to provide a secure living farm for families, maintain the natural environment and resources, support the rural community, and offer fair fair treatment and respect to those involved. Other benefits of consuming organic foods include possibly higher nutritional benefits such as more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These foods are not necessarily healthier than non organic foods, however they may provide added health benefits and provide a more environmentally and socioeconomically friendly alternative for food production.
I would say for our purposes conventional is best simply because organic does not mean healthier and the amount of pesticides present on these foods has not been said to be bad for health in any way.
eat health!
I would  choose Conventional farming because the lines of where the food is made and what is in it is more clear and does not contain additive's.  I know that I am eating something natural and not made to be natural. I am also saving money by doing this. To create organic foods, there has to separate farms to care for animals like the cows who produce more waste for the environment. Buying organic does not help the environment. 
I think that making natural gas from cow manure is a great idea to sustain energy, since we already have so many cows in the US
I think the first option is the best. It seems more logical and safer.
I think organic farming is the better option because it is better for the enviornment and  improve the condition of soil 
animal green house gas emissions  methane production  technology 1 meatless pollution
I would tell my friends sustainable farming is the better option for many reasons. One, sustainable farming is better for the environment. It maintains soil quality which reduces soil degradation and erosion which saves water. Sustainable farming is also better for agriculture. 
meatless makes a difference in our planet reduces global warming saves animals  1 to eat meat I eat meat but I've never been as informed as I am now
Everyone in part should do research until a decision is made.  I believe conventual is the same nutrients than organic.
I do not believe organic farming is the best because it is more expensive to produce product, making the product more expensive.
animal sourse produces methane which fuels transportation and is an innovative solution meatless its better for the environment
I would tell my friends that beef is not sustainable because most farms use the most cheap and efficient methods that they can.
Everyone in part should do research until a decision is made.  I believe conventual is the same nutrients than organic.
I would tell my friends that although it is more expensive, organic is the way to go. It is healthier with no chemicals and less pesticides
I will tell my friend based on the video that organic farming is definitely the way to go and the reason behind that is because they use less chemicals in their soil which makes the food healthier for the buyer also not only is organic farming healthier for us as human beings but it was also helpful for pollution and things like that with the world.
I think i would tell my friend that we should look into a new way to do organic foods. If droughts are already becoming a problem, we shouldnt add to the lack of water.
I would say the best option is truly up to you and your lifestyle. If you're going to eat meat, then just be sure that it is a good quality meat, and do not go overboard with it. 
Organic because it can be better for the environment
organic is the best option for food because there are no chemicals present in the food, it maintains biodiversity, and there are less pesticides present
I would personally tell them that if they want to eat organic foods but can't afford it, that they should try to grow it themselves. 
meatless option greenhouse gas emissions Methane production runoff in water meat option the technology we have today can conteract this pollution
meatless greenhouse gas emissions methane fueling transportation methane production meat they dont consider the environment
based on the videos i wold tell my friends that although it is more expensive, in the long run, eating organically is a good choice.
I will tell them to eat meat if they please too because animals are someone else food chain and you should eat what you enjoy just in moderation.
I would tell my friends that the best option is to cut down on using our resources like we have an unlimited supply. We don't have enough resources in the world for every person in the world so we must be responsible when it comes to our Earth and not take it for granted. 
I would tell my friends that neither is the better option. I highly doubt that organic food consumption is going to sky-rocket, however they can feel free to eat whichever kind of food that they want. Sure, it is cheaper to eat conventional food, but if they can feel free to pay the up-charge for organic foods.
It honestly depends. It depends from what perspective you are looking at the problem from. Which choice would be better from the perspective of feeding all the world population? From this particular standpoint, the best option would be to stick with conventional farming. Organic farming does not yield enough to feed our growing population. If we can figure out a way to increase our yield using organic farming methods, that would be the best option. The other perspective is from the environmental/health perspective. Which is the best option for the environment and our health? Organic farming methods limit the amount of additives and pesticides they use on their crops. And we know this is a huge plus for our environment and health in general. Decreases the chances of pesticides having a long-term impact on our bodies. 
I would tell my friends to eat organic foods in moderation. There is no need to eliminate all conventional foods, but some organic foods here and there would be okay. Locally grown produce is also a good alternative because you see where your money is going and who produced it. The main reason why I would choose organic is because it is more kind to animals. There are also no chemicals and less pesticides, so you know all the ingredients you are putting into your body, despite the higher cost. 
The best option would be to not use organic farming because there is only a slighter difference and using organic farming, there are no pesticides to protect the food, therefore wastes more.
To tell them the truth
I would tell them to ask politely if they could just pay for their own organic food and you pay your own food since you don't eat that type of food so you shouldn't have to pay more. 
Based on the videos I watched, in the first video there was a fact stated that Americans have started to eat more tofu, turkey and chicken rather than ground beef.  This is the best option because tofu, turkey and chicken is still giving our bodies the sources of protein we need and they're so much better for us.
I would suggest buying more organic produce however, i would still be open to and understand the other roommate's desire to buy conventional foods. 
I would tell them the first choice is the best
I would tell a friend that organic farming is the best option because it does not involve using chemical pesticides which may be harmful.
Meatless reduces methane production reduces emissions prevents runoff water contamination meat it is a large part of the diet and "one person doesn't make a difference" is a hard mindset to beat without looking through the facts
I would say grass fed meat is the best option because it is healthier for us and also better for the environment as a whole.
I would tell a friend that organic farming is the best option because it is more sustainable. Organic farming does not use pesticides and is natural. The only issue is that farmers do not know what nutrients are in some compost and manure and how these nutrients will benefit their crops. Organic farming is less harmful for the environment because chemicals are not used.
I would tell my friends to eat whatever they want. Everyone is different and most of my friends always tell me "I do what I want" despite logical reasoning.
To go with their gut and whatever feels right.
The best option is to eat organic because it has no chemicals and fewer pesticides, and is healthy for you and the environment. 
meatless options reduces runoff in water reduces methane production reduces greenhouse gas emissions 1 the meat option I, too, enjoy hamburgers
I would tell my friends that both options are good but that I would choose conventional farming because it uses less natural resources than organic farming.
meatless creating innovative solutions methane prodiction runoff in water animal source its their choice
I would say organic food is better because even in real life I try to eat organic as much as possible. I love eating healthy and even though it may be a little more expensive, I love the organic foods that I buy. 
There isn't a better option. They are both reasonable and being debated still for a good reason. When there's a ratio of pro's and con's for both and just as equally good/bad. I am undecided on the topic of organic vs. non-organic. Similarly, scientists can't decided one side or another because while organic food can be good, it can also be bad and lead to worse events. For example, there's more unhealthy gases in the air from organic cows than regular. 
Based on the videos I would suggest to my friends to consume less beef and be more proactive in what they put into their bodies.  I did not know that such a simple thing as a hamburger could have such a negative effect on the Earth. 
Meat is important to consume because it provides the body with essential nutrients that other food can can not provide  
Organic food, because organic food honestly better for you in the long run because even if you don't feel the effects of the chemicals now you will feel the effects of those foods in the future when you are older.
I would tell my friend that eating organically is the best option because it takes a much lesser impact against the environment, and the environment needs to be preserved for as long as we are able to keep it preserved.  By keeping it preserved longer, we make it easier for generations to come to keep up with all the work that our generation can do to preserve and conserve resources on the planet.  The main reason that people don't buy organic foods is because they are more expensive, however after more and more people start to buy organic foods, the prices should drop, and putting the money towards that is much better than putting it towards large companies and farms that use chemical substances constantly, wasting the planet's resources.
I would say that developing health habits now such as switching some food groups and instead implementing more organic substitutes is best for nurturing good health 
Sustainable farming is clearly the more sensible and more earth friendly option. This type of farming turned one situation to another situation which is great for the earth and the economy in a sense. These farmers use the milk and manure to create this renewable natural gas that is very so much Clean Natural Gas that allows major opportunity instead of causing contamination. 
To me, organic foods seem like the more healthy choice so that is what I would tell my friends. However, they are far more expensive.
I would recommend the organic way because it provides us with the best resources when it comes to pertaining to the body . It as well help the world in a more helpful manner instead of all the chemicals beginning to be put into our foods now. Its more of a health way of eating and saving the planet. 
Definitely organically grown and produced foods sound like they are the healthier and better choice, but they also need to aware and educated on the fact that someone's 100% organic may not be everyone's 100% organic. I still believe that organic farming is better for the environment though it takes more effort and space than conventional farming. This is how farming should be done, but also there is the worry about not enough farmland. However with cities developing everyday and gentrification usurping valuable land I believe perhaps all countries should take a step back and really examine how we are using resources.
meatless is healthier better for the planet more humane 1 meat  meat is good
Clearly the best option is the Dairy Farm Fair Oaks (Second Video). The whole process of what this farm is doing is solving a major pollution problem in the world today. Instead of the methane being released to pollute the air some of it is digested through pipes to power the farm and the rest of it is used as fuel that runs the farm's fleet of trucks. What can't be used after the digestion process, is put on the grounds as fertilization. This choice is the better option of the two regarding the conservation of our world. 
Based on the videos I would tell my friends to limit the consumption of beef due to the negative effects it has on the environment. 
meatless option is healthier better for the environment helps local farms meat of their pre-existing thoughts
the option i would tell people to do it farm inorganically because it uses far less land that ends up becoming polluted because the overuse of the land of trying to grow crops normally when they die halfway through
i know my friends really like burgers so maybe the sustainable farming would be best. The reason being that it is helping the earth as well as being able to feed people at the same time. I feel that it could be said as killing two birds with one stone.
Conventional because it can sustain the human population better then the alternative.
the meatless option is only one time a week it helps the environment  is healthier 1 meat  there are ways to eat it safely
Conventional meat eating, because it maintains biodiversity, and if eaten organically, doesn't include chemicals.
I would tell my friends about video two because it shows how organic products are good and bad.  This allows people not to choose sides and also gives good information on how not every organic product is fully 100% organic. 
It is obvious the meat industry has some extremely bad effects on the environment and on general health, but it is also obvious that counter efforts can be made to combat these effects through education on the subjects and creative thinking. It is unrealistic to say people should not eat meat, but buying meat from sources such as these can create a change that is much more achievable.
Go organic because of chemicals, pesticides and biodiversity.
The best option would be to be as informed about the topic as you can be and to make educated decisions based off of it 
i would use the sustainable farming, because it doesn't hurt the earth as much because its using natural gas and natural resources. 
I would tell them that they should consider to just stick with the conventional food. The conventional food may not b healthier for you and might have more chemicals or pesticides but it is cheaper and with organic food you can't even know for sure how chemical free it actually is every organic food has different percents. Living in house with two other people you need to consider how much you are affecting everyone in the house with your diet change and how much more we would be spending on grocies.
I would suggest for my friends to cut down on beef and dairy consumption all together, as it is a change i have already made in my life (i eat pork and chicken, and rarely red meat. I do not drink milk). Cutting down on a smaller scale will have big results if enough people do it, compared to farms spending millions to fix a problem that we as consumers can fix just by making a healthier dietary choice.
People and companies have been making strides to improve the way meat/cows are handled. Not only with changing the way they are being fed but also in to using the whole aspect of the cow to sustain life and do it in a way that doesn't harm the planet. I personally don't consume beef that often but now being presented with the information that I was I am more motivated to buy from the company that is trying to be less of a burden on the planet. I believe that a meat diet is a better diet but to do all things in moderation.  
Going organic is better for your body and the environment. 
I wuold be honest wiht my friens, wihout trying to hurt their feelings but by also getting my point across
I would tell my friends to eat organic. This is because although it dissent give many more health benefits than non organic, it is a bit safer because it contains no chemicals.
I would tell them the optimal diet is mixed and varies from person to person
I think that buying local, organic foods are the best option because theyre fresher, better for us and better for the environment. 
I would tell my friend that eating organically is the best option because it takes a much lesser impact against the environment, and the environment needs to be preserved for as long as we are able to keep it preserved.  By keeping it preserved longer, we make it easier for generations to come to keep up with all the work that our generation can do to preserve and conserve resources on the planet.  The main reason that people don't buy organic foods is because they are more expensive, however after more and more people start to buy organic foods, the prices should drop, and putting the money towards that is much better than putting it towards large companies and farms that use chemical substances constantly, wasting the planet's resources.
Meatleass option is better greener meat sources they are too lazy to try and not eat meat.
That using the manure to create gas is better because there is less pollution going into the atmosphere. 
The best option is be an open minded thinker.
that they should think more about the world , and issues that effect them.
I think conventional farming is the best option because it produces high yields to sustain our population. Also, organic farming has many negative byproducts such as needing more land and water which we simply do not have because those are scarce resources. By acquiring more land it would damage the environment even more so that defeats the purpose of organic being healthy and good for everyone. Also cows produce twice as much methane gas on organic farms than on conventional farms so while trying to reduce the environmental footprint I feel like it is too late and we have already caused too much damage. Therefore, I believe we should stick with what is working which is conventional farming.
I would say the use of organic farming. Since organic food production avoids the use of chemicals, it doesn't show any risk of soil and underground water contamination, unlike the other farming
I would tell my friends to try to eat organically as possible because it benefits both physical and mental health as well as the environment 
Organic farming is the better option because it uses natural fertilizers instead of chemicals which contaminate the soil and atmosphere.  It also is much healthier for the actual plants being grown.
I would not say one is better than the other. I think she should buy some foods organic and some not just to have a good balance. 
I would probably tell my friends that organic farming is great in theory, but just not possible for the number of people of Earth. It also sounds like organic farming is worse for the environment than conventional farming methods
I would tell my friends about sustainable farming because I think it is really smart how the famers are making use of two products from cows: the manure and the milk. I also like how some of the manure is used as a fertilizer while the rest is used as renewable gas and it is not harmful. 
meatless option is suitable for my dietary needs healthy protein can still be eaten in other food groups than meat 1 the meat option it is what works for them
To try to eat meat when you don't have too or choose to only eat it once a week instead of 3. This can help the environment and lower pollution the more people do it
Not sure its based on their opinions beliefs food preference 1 meatless there are benefits
The best option would be to be as informed about the topic as you can be and to make educated decisions based off of it 
To buy conventional fruits because the cost for buying organic is a factor we all need to consider. 
non animal source produces greenhouse gas emissions water runoff methane animal source of all the negative aspects that go along with that particular food choice
The second option because it provides an easier and clearer solution.
To buy regular food because it gives you the same amount of energy per day. It also isn't as much money as organic food
I would tell my friends more about the first video and the harm that meat production and cattle farms have on us and the environment. While the information in the second video is a step forward for the world and the environment, not many other farms around the world are doing the same thing, making it important that we as consumers take steps to limit our meat and dairy consumption.
the best opinion for me is to continue to eat meat because it is what I am used to, but I do understand people that dont eat meat. 
Although hearing the word "organic" makes a lot of people want to turn to eating all organic, I would tell my friends that the better option is not to eat organic. Although there may be added preservatives and pesticides, the food that is being sold is still safe. Creating an all organic farms presents more greenhouse gases from the methane produced from the cows, and uses a lot more water supply than non organic foods. Although they both have their pros and cons, I would say that eating non organic is definitely not a bad thing, and would help little by little save our environment.
to eat organically because it is better for your health
Organic foods use no pesticides or chemicals, which will undoubtedly make them healthier for humans in long-term. Therefore, organic food is the best option.

animal source  creates innovated solutions technologies can counteract pollution methane fueling transportation is an important substitute from fossil fuels 2 non-animal source eating beef is very important, and should not be substituted by a non-animal source. Technologies can always be invented to prevent the negatives that are associated with animal-sourced food.
The best option would be taking all of the cow manure produced and turning it into renewable energy to power trucks and other buildings.  
Organc is definitely the better chose because it contains less pesticides, maintains biodiversity and there are no chemicals.
I would tell them the best option would be organic. I would tell them organic because the foods contain less chemicals, and less pesticides. The only issue is they tend to be more expensive.
To eat healthier because its cheaper and will help your body in the long run. It takes meat a while to digest.While vegetables digest easily and live you feeling full and light.
ill mainly go with and tell my friends to choose the 2 option, because its using the natural resources that they get from the cows in order to power everything around them. By using cow poop and such to fuel there fleet of trucks to feeding us as humans.
To choose what is best for them.
I said the second video would be the best choice just caused it tell us the good side of the cows and how people use cow manure in a different but efficient way for the environment


meatless less fats less hormones less animal cruelty meat protein
Though I am completely for helping the environment, I am also a realist and with that being said I would advise my friends the best choice would be inorganic foods. As was stated in the video, to have organic farming would require a mass amount of water and land that would not be possible to obtain. Organic farms also require a lot of work from farmers themselves because although some chemicals can be used they rarely are. Pesticides get into the plants causing farmers to have to start over many times. All in all, organic seems like a great idea but realistically it would not happen. 
I will tell them to make the decision that's best for them. 
organic because it is overall better for you and is worth the money
I would tell my friends that organic farming is much more beneficial for us to eat and better for the environment (less pesticides) but with the constant increase of people in our world, it may not be the smartest/most sustainable option. 
I believe that organic farming may be something we want to achieve, it is very hard to obtain and keep up with. For example, the less pesticides we use the less crops we get and therefore we can not keep up with the growing population of 7.5 billion. Parts of organic farming should tried to be used, but cutting out pesticides completely would be unrealistic. 
I would tell them the second one because it seems to have all the pros and cons and it could answer all potential questions. 
I feel as if both have their pros and cons, organic farming allows for things to be recycled but also is much harder to control certain variables, regular farming has no smell, more controllable, and you know how many minerals something is receiving. I feel as if regular framing is better 
To me there is a good and bad to everything so I would just tell them what I think is the best option and let them choose for themselves. 
The choice I would tell my friends is to cut down on the amount of red meat they consume. I would tell them this because they probably do not understand everything that is happening to the earth because the amount of red meat we eat and what we are doing with cows in general. I would tell them this to inform them and make them non ignorant because it is unlikely that they know the situation and what is happening.
The best option would be organic farming as it is the most natural way of farming. There are no herbicides, pesticides or fertilizer used. In organic farming manure is used as fertilizer, the farm is weeded instead of sprayed with pesticides, and the ecosystem is healthier with more animals from bees to foxes, making the farming process far more natural and healthy.  
I would tell them to stay with conventional farming because it is going to be cheaper, and and more efficient than organic farming. Humans have been trying to perfect farming in mass quantity for thousands of years, conventional is the mainstream and effective way to grow. 
I would say that developing health habits now such as switching some food groups and instead implementing more organic substitutes is best for nurturing good health 
I would choose to tell them to make there own choice. Your own choice is the best and can only come back to you at the end of the day.
I would tell my friend to go organic and meatless. Going this way is better for the environment, better for your health and better for the animals in the environment. We can sustain ourselves off of plant based organic foods, or just even plant based.
The second choice definitely, as it is cleaner, and most cost-effective. 
If you purchase organic food it lowers the chances of the product containing any harmful chemicals for humans. So in that case I would say it is best as it lowers the chances of you catching any health changing chemicals instead of non-organic foods.  
To lower your beef consumption and think of grass fed beef as an alternative
I would say organic because it is healthier, has less chemicals and has less pesticides.
I would tell my friends that it is worth it to pay more for the organic food because there is less pesticides and chemicals used on the food which is healthier for you to consume.
Organic are grass fed, have no antibiotics, and have no hormones. Try to stay away from red meats, always eat what is naturally grown like fruits or vegetables. Make sure foods are naturally raised and fresh. 
Animal Source  counteracts  pollution using technology  takes waste and turns it into methane and  gives the fuel to the trucks   1 Meatless option  Cows are taking too much land
I would say go with your gut, maybe try to buy locally from a farmer's market a few times a month, but ultimately organic costs more and that sometimes isn't sustainable for college students. I do think that eating some organic foods is good for the environment, but nutritionally  I don't think they necessarily have more value. 
try to eat more green and organic foods and cut back on beef. this is because the way of life of cows is so harmful so our earth with all of the waste and co2 they produce
I think in the Dirty 12, it's good to eat organically, but in the clean 15, I think eating organically is best, especially on a budget! :)
the meat option creates innovative solutions a type of methane fueling transportation the technologies counteract pollution a meatless option of greenhouse gas emission
I would tell my friend the best option is sustainable farming because, you know where your meat products are coming from, how they are treated, and you know the company invests a lot of time, research, and money in producing high quality products.
Organic is healthy, however, may cost more than general foods. Organic food production is good for the environment
meat option creates innovative solutions has methane fueling transportation technologies can counteract pollution meatless option of the health benefits
I think that a good mix between industrial style and organic style farming is a simple mix of the two. Obviously, it would he extremely harmful to the environment to purely stick to one style. Rather, we should incorporate a little bit of both for a more solid and non-destructive resolution.
I would tell them to do what the felt was the best 
I would definitely recommend eating organic because it contains fewer pesticides, less preservatives, less antibiotics, growth hormones etc. It is overall healthier 
Organic would be the best option because it not only benefits the environment but also peoples' nutrition. It also has a strong direct impact on employment which is hard for some to find.
the meatlessoption greenhouse gas emissons runoff in water methan fueling transport eating meat After watching the second video and seeing that people are creating innovation solutions and technologies that counter act pollution.
the Non-Animal Source reduces methane production fertilizer runoff in water greenhouse emissions  the Meat Option it tastes better and its cheaper
I believe that organic farming is better. It seems as though it is better for the environment and better for the produce. Using none, or less, pesticides is definitely a better choice than over using them. There are some issues though with organic farming. Organic farming does not seem very practical. It restricts farmers from being able to grown in large masses. With a growing population and a higher need of produce, it seems almost illogical and unrealistic to organically farm even though it may be healthier. 
I'd say to purchase products from conventional farming as there is not enough evidence that says organic is healthier or safer for the environment. There are pros and cons that were discussed in the video, but not enough to convince me to go organic. Although organic farms only take 1% of the land, if they continue to grow there will have to be deforestation which I strongly oppose and to me that's already not worth buying produce that although it has fewer pesticides hasn't been proven to be healthier. 
I would eat clean and organic vegetables for my body and persuade my friends as well for us to be safe.
organic because its better for your body and the environment 
The best choice is to eat organic food because it has no chemicals, has less pesticides, and maintains biodeversity.
Eat meat as a protein source (but be careful of what you eat)  because unless done very carefully it is difficult to be a healthier vegetarian. 
Organic is usually the better way to go in my opinion. It's better for the environment in a lot of ways, is healthier and you won't feel as bad eating it (especially pre-made freezer meals).
Conventional because it is more accommodating and less expensive.
I would say organic is the better decision because it is healthier.
Organic food because it is healthier however I would advise them to do research on the brand their buying an not just believe the product is organic because of a label.
The organic option is better for ones health and environment. Although it is more expensive, in the long run it makes more sense.
I'm not sure honestly 
The best option is to go organic as it uses less pesticides,  no chemicals, and maintains biodiversity
I think organic because you know where it comes from. Also organic foods are all natural and have no chemicals in the food like some of the food that is conventional. It may be expensive but it is the healthier alternative.
Organic because it is much better for us to consume and free of GMOs and chemical pesticides 
meat has solutions that can be created  technologies can counteract pollution can be good if eaten in moderation 1 the meatless option meat can be harmful if not consumed properly
Although the meat industry contributes a large amount of greehouse gasses and pollution, making changes such as using the cows manure for fuel and decreasing your meat intake weekly can make changes to support the enviornment. 
Personally I would tell my friends that nonorganic is the best option. I don't believe that the chemicals make all that detrimental of an effect on out health and nonorganic is significantly cheaper. Keeping in mind that we are all in college, if all our parents never ate organic food and are still fine now, hopefully we will too. Also, organic farming can't sustain the world. Regular farming can't sustain it either, but there's at least a greater, faster, and more consistent output of food.
I would tell my friends that if they had the money they should buy organic foods because three are no chemicals, it maintains biodiversity and uses less pesticides.
I would tell my friends to eat whatever they want. Everyone is different and most of my friends always tell me "I do what I want" despite logical reasoning.
I believe the sustainable farming is the best option because it is not only healthier consuming the products from these cows but they also use the manure to produce a natural gas which powers these trucks to take milk all over. They are using things that most other farms would dispose of or just let sit there (manure) and using it as renewable energy. They are saving money rather than costing themselves and others more.
I believe that organic farming is better. It seems as though it is better for the environment and better for the produce. Using none, or less, pesticides is definitely a better choice than over using them. There are some issues though with organic farming. Organic farming does not seem very practical. It restricts farmers from being able to grown in large masses. With a growing population and a higher need of produce, it seems almost illogical and unrealistic to organically farm even though it may be healthier. 
I would say the best option is organic because there are less pesticides and chemicals involved, which doesn't affect the environment as much. Therefore, it can leaf to greater biodiversity. 
I would say natural organic farming is a lot better. Even though it's a lot of labor it is better for the environment and for your self 
I think that going vegan is a good choice because it not only is more humane for animals, but it will also benefit the environment greatly, thus further sustaining human life. 
I don't think there is a better or worse choice. The first video shows us all the damaging aspects of using the beef industries our meat protein sources but also offered easy ways to make improvements like cutting out meat and cheese from your diet just one day a week. The second video showed how farmers can use the harmful methane gas the first video talks about, and put it to good use by using it to transport the farm's milk, a good source of protein for humans.
I believe the option the second video portrayed, with the endless cycle of processing manure and turning it into clean gas that then could be used to cart the products made on the farm all over. The main concern from the first video was about pollution from the cows and their manure and I believe that the second video took a lot of that out of the environment. 
I would tell my friends to try and eat less meat. Meat seems to cause a lot of problems in the world and I think if we all decided to eat less meat then we could better the world. A person does not have to completely stop eating meat in order to help, but even just not eating meat for one day could help. 
I would say organic foods are the best option. This is because of the dangerous chemicals that they use to increase the growth rate and yield of the crops. even though they cost more, it is worth it in the end
I would tell them to do what the felt was the best 
I would tell my friends the best options are organic foods because they are healthier for your body and even though it is more expensive it is worth to have fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet. 
To go meatless
meat can create solutions can counteract pollution methane production 1 meatless they may want more vegetables
Orgainic is the best option overall for your health, for animals, for the environment etc. 
Organic... same reasons why I do. Already stated.
Organic, it may cost more but it is much better for your body and the environment. 
I would say organic farming is the better option because it is best for the environment in the long run. Although it may not be as efficient and inexpensive as other methods, it keeps the land healthier for further use.
organic, because it's better for you as well as the planet. I know it's more expensive, but the outcomes are worth it.  
It is best to choose a moderate approach. There are many costs of the hamburger and it may be harmful to a diet but if you would like to eat in moderation it is okay.
We could not afford to provide organic food to everyone in the world because it wouldn't be the same, but organic food helps the environment in soo many ways, so I choose organic
Organic seems healthier for your body but harder to maintain and keep up with
the meatless option helps the environment is just as healthy only sacrifices once a week 1 to eat the meat there are other ways to improve the industry
The second option, because instead of trying to disassemble the beef industry it not only allows for peoples' diets to stay the same but also produces a new source of alternative energy as well.
I would tell my friends that organic is not better because to sustain the earth and with how many people live here we cant afford the cost of organic food. 
I think the best option choice is organic farming foods because its a more natural alternative, the product is healthier because less chemical is used on them and it's more friendly with the environment. 
I would tell my friends that they should use conventional food, because though it has more chemicals, there is no health risks that come from it and the food comes at a cheaper cost.
To try and not buy meat items made in factories because they do not use natural alternatives which is harmful to our planet.
I would tell my friends that the conventional eater should just try out organic since we have been eating conventional for so long. We could try that for awhile, and we can even alternate meals for the conventional friend, but always have organic options. Also, tell the organic friend if that doesn't work, she will have to buy her own food and the two of us conventional eaters will have to split. Or vice versa depending if I went organic. 
Organic because no chemicals added, maintains biodiversity and creates more jobs. 
I think the best option is to cut out sugared foods and limit meat consumption
I would tell them to choose organic because it is better for the environment and your health. Although it may be a little more expensive, it is overall a better option.
i would say organic food is healthier for us and the environment 
Organic, because in the long run it will help our environment sustain itself and produces more jobs. 
After watching both videos, I can confidently say that organic and conventional farming both have their fair share of pros and cons. I think itâ€™s paramount that a balance is found. While organic farming may seem like the more environmentally friendly option, it produces a lower yield. If organic farming (which currently only makes up about 1% of farming in the world) were to replace conventional farming, a significantly larger amount of land would be required. I recognize that in todayâ€™s world, quantity often prevails over quality. In our fast-paced society, people love convenience. We are constantly looking to make things as efficient as possible. Our population has never been higher, and will only continue to grow. With that said it, it only makes sense that yield is one of the most important factors of modern farming. While globalizing organic farming is probably not a very realistic option, I certainly believe that organic farming should be a global influence. This means maintaining high levels of biodiversity and soil health. I am aware of the animal abuse that is commonplace in conventional farming. This treatment is appalling, unacceptable, and inhumane. I personally believe that treating animals with dignity and respect should be prioritized. If removing animals from dark, confined and unsanitary sheds damage yield, then so be it. While it can be easy to get up in the quest for ultimate efficiency, we canâ€™t forget about the moral/ ethical responsibilities we have as humans. To summarize, I think the most realistic option would be to continue on with conventional farming as the most dominant form of farming in the world. However, I in no way believe that the current state of conventional farming is the best it could be. Thereâ€™s plenty of room for improvement for the current treatment of the environment/ animals. Methods of sustainability need to become more widespread- not only in farming, but in all realms of this world.


After listening to the videos, I actually learned a lot about organic farming. I did not realize that organic farms can still use pesticides and other additives to their food. However, still a lot less than regular store bought produce, etc. The best type of food would be the local farms etc. I believe that after watching those videos, I would tell my friends to buy the "dirty 12" organically and the "clean 15" inorganically. That way, we can eliminate as much pesticide use as possible. 
Organic foods use no pesticides or chemicals, which will undoubtedly make them healthier for humans in long-term. Therefore, organic food is the best option.
I will personally eat organic and I will tell my friends too because it is more natural and safer.
I would tell a friend eating organic is the best option because it is better for your body as well as the health of the planet. 
I would tell my friends the best option is to choose organically grown foods and choose foods from local markets. 
I would tell my friends that the conventional eater should just try out organic since we have been eating conventional for so long. We could try that for awhile, and we can even alternate meals for the conventional friend, but always have organic options. Also, tell the organic friend if that doesn't work, she will have to buy her own food and the two of us conventional eaters will have to split. Or vice versa depending if I went organic. 
Organic farming. It seems to be more ethically reasonable.
I would recommend they stay conventional, regardless of the video. I don't agree with going organic.
not sure is a hard one Meat options Meatless options 1 to go meatless of beliefs and facts
I think non organic is the best option. Even though organic food is supposed to be better for our environment, organic food uses more land to grow than non organic food.
Based on what I heard in the videos, the best option is to cut down on beef. We drive the commercial farming of beef. The production of beef is costly, uses up too much of our natural resources, and is responsible for a vast majority of our greenhouse gases. The costs outweigh the benefits.  
I would say that Organic is the best option for one's personal health, due to the smaller amount of chemicals used in the foods and the more local farms. However it is not attainable for whole populations due to the amount of resources it uses that are already running low. 
I think there needs to be a health medium between both conventional and and natural farming. I do believe some natural farming should be keep for the some individuals for society willing to pay for it. However, natural farming needs to have more limitations on the amount of land used. I also believe conventional farming should still be able to use pesticides but needs to have strict boundaries.   
Conventional foods, because I know organic foods are more expensive and you have to go to a farmers market to get them. Plus most of my friends don't have the kind of money to spend on organic foods or the patients to find a farmers market to get the organic foods. 
I would tell my friends to eat organic because it is overall better for the body, using pesticides and chemicals is bad for your health and there is no reason to be consuming them.
The best choice would be to go vegan. Stop torturing the animals.
Non-Animal Source Creating Innovative solutions Technology can counteract pollution Methane fueling Transportation  Animal Source beliefs
I would tell them that organic is the way to go until more scientific research occurs on how it could be worse than conventional farming. 
Organic farming because it is better for the health and for the environment 
meatless is healthier cheaper we eat too much meat as protein anyways,  meat it is an easy way of protein
The best option is be an open minded thinker.
Organic farming. Even though this method takes more time and land, it is safer for the environment. Humans have to accept the struggles within it and will be able to help better our planet if they use this farming method.
I feel that a meatless diet would be best due to the lack of pesticides and chemicals, and it maintains biodiversity.
In terms of the environment I would tell my friends that the natural process of growing crops is the best option as it has less of an impact on the increase of methane, uses less water, and less land. In terms of health, I would say organic crops are better because they are good for biodiversity within other animals and livelihoods and humans would be consuming less chemicals from crops that would be using pesticides.  
Meatless Option lessens an increase in consumption that affects your health Reduces land/ and cost that it takes to feed cows  prevents run offs of methane and water 1 the meat option it is true that innovative practices have been made possible by eating meat.
to go meatless  will help solve problems is efficient  is overall better for the environment  1 meat of their personal beliefs
People should cut down on the amount of meat consumed daily as well as junk food and sugar, and focus more on the healthy stuff like fruits and vegetables because it's not only bad for humans but for the environment 
I would personally tell them that if they want to eat organic foods but can't afford it, that they should try to grow it themselves. 
I would tell my friends (if I had any) that buying inorganic products is better than buying organic products.  One, because it is much cheaper and I cannot afford to buy all organic products.  Second, based on the videos I watched and what I've learned in class, organic products do not have to be 100% organic to be labeled as "organic" in the United States.  Lastly, organic products may also be worse for the environment than inorganic products because they require use of more resources. 
Conventional would be the best choice
non-animal source reduces greenhouse gas emissons reduces methane production runoff in water animal source they believe the protein is beneficial to their health
meatless option is better for the environment is generally healthier can help stop the production of green house gases 1 the animal option that is what we know to eat, and sometimes we do not realize that the same amount of protein that is found in chicken is also found in vegetables
Organic is the best choice because organic foods contain no chemicals, less pesticides and maintains biodiversity.
I would tell my friend the best option is organic farming for the reason they use less pesticides and are said to maintain biodiversity. But I would also say there is nothing wrong with conventional farming either because its up to speed on where its needed to be at, as well as its cheaper for us. 
Organic because it is made naturally and nothing manufactured is added.  
The second video is the best choice for the environment because it does allow that company to turn manure into fuel which helps power the 18 wheelers that carry the milk around the country.  
Although organic farming may not produce as big of a crop yield than conventional farming, it focuses on sustainability of the environment which I believe is more important. Organic farming doesn't use chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides or feed additives for livestock. The manure produced by cows specifically is used to recycle waste and improve the soil structure. Other factors such as weeding...the preferred organic farming, may mean that it is more labor intensive but makes more jobs available‚Ä¶more economically friendly and chemical free. Overall, organic farming is the best option because it helps to maintain the biodiversity better rather than conventional farming because fewer chemicals are used. 
I can't say I would want to try to sway my friends' thinking one way or another, honestly the best option might be for each of us to purchase the groceries that we want to eat. 
Organic, because it has no chemicals and less pesticides, although it is a little more pricey.
I think sustainable farming is the best option because it is farming while using good techniques that protect the environment, animal welfare and public health. It also does not compromise on future generations needs to help and meet the needs of society right now.


Meat Option has tech that can counteract pollution made meat taste good why not? to have a vegan diet of their health
organic farming is better because of it healthy for you. Yes, some might cost a lot to buy food but it worth it because of it good for your health and you might live longer.
I would say organic farming is a better option than conventional farming because there are no pesticides, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics, or additives. There is also less harm done to the environment, which is important with so many issues with the planet as it is.
Being an organic eater is good for some people but It is not the choice that I would make because then you have to also take supplements to keep your body vitamins in check
I would tell my friends that organic foods are better. They have no harmful chemicals, and are better for the environment. They create better environments for animal life, and results in more jobs. Organic foods also use manure which is better for the land in comparison to chemicals. 
meatless removes greenhouse gas emissions methane production runoff on water eating meat sources they are a great source of protein and other nutriets
I would tell them that although organic foods are processed without preservatives or additives, the amount of energy required to produce organic foods may come at a higher cost to our environment. 
I would say for a personal perspective, organic farming is the better option just because it is more natural, but when you look at the grand scheme of things, conventional farming would be better to feed everyone because of the higher yields.
Animal Source methane fueling transportation  creating innovative solutions  technologies can counteract pollution  1 meatless it does harm the animal and create a lot of pollution in the environment.
type here
To choose what is best for them.
The first video over organic farming is the best option. There are so many alternative ways for 'healthy' farming techniques that do not harm the environment but are actually good for it. I do not have a lot of knowledge on farming but the video was very knowledgable about explaining all the techniques. One technique I thought was the best was weeding; it is more time consuming but it provides jobs and is good for the planet. 
I would say go organic as much as you can. It is expensive but it also saves the environment. If we don't work on saving Earth then how are we supposed to live? 
Eating organic food is the best choice for the environment as well as your body and health. 
I like the organic farming because it brings high nutrition values and improved human health.
meatless greenhouse gas emissions methane production runoff in water 1 meat it is good to eat.
To tell them the truth
I think in the Dirty 12, it's good to eat organically, but in the clean 15, I think eating organically is best, especially on a budget! :)
meatless reduces gas emissions reduces methane production reduces runoff in water 1 meat option there are ways to combat these issues.
I would say that in theory, organic farming sounds great but it may not be the best choice. I would like more research on the carbon footprint organic farming creates. Because it takes more space, it could cause more damage to the environment than intended. Like the video pointed out, forests would have to be cleared out in order to make room for more farmland. Also I would also want to know the heath benefits of eating organic products versus eating nonorganic products, and in what way did the subjects health differ. The definition of organic foods varies from country to country. Because we import a lot of products from around the world, some may be labeled organic but are not up to the US standards for organic products. 
The overall best option, is organic food over conventional. It is the better choice for a healthy diet, because of the nutritional value provided. Conventional food includes processed food which contains pesticides and chemicals which are not good for the body. It is more convenient for people on the run to stop by a fast food restaurant or to choose the cheaper product, but with most things the cheaper option might not be the best option. For anyone, but mostly people concerned about or interested in pursing a healthier lifestyle choosing to go organic, is a great option. 
Beat Options The ability to produce renewable fuel sources Good source of protein and fats for the human diet organically fed livestock  1 meatless options of the negative health, environmental effects and even in-humane treatment of slaughter houses.
I think it really depends on what products they are buying. in some instances buying organic makes better sense and others it does not.
i would tell my friends to look up the info themselves and make their own decision. 
Honestly, I can't tell you what is good and what is not. It is up to the person what they want to do with their body and what they want to put in it. 
Conventional farming is better than organic because it is more affordable and both organic and conventional use pesticides so there is not too much of a difference. If all farms were organic there would not be enough product to support the population due to the fact that organic farming uses more land therefore conventional farming is necessary. Scientists are also still debating whether or not organic is healthier for you therefore as of right now there is no proof that organic is healthier than conventional. 
Based on what I heard in the two videos, I would tell my friends that there are just as many pro and cons between conventional and organic farming. It's difficult to choose which is the better option because of this. If there were a more reliable source explaining each and every pro and con of them both, then it would be easier to choose. But in all honesty, almost every source that speaks of this topic is very biased. There are also no nutrient differences between the two, therefore I would tell my friends that the decision of which is better is to their own discretion. 
I would tell my friends that organic is not better because to sustain the earth and with how many people live here we cant afford the cost of organic food. 
organic , because there are less chemicals and not only is it better for them it also helps out the environment 
I would tell my friends The hidden cost of meat and I will also tell them how to fix the world and how by just simply taking one burger away a week could do so much difference in the world and the reason why I would tell them that is because not only will it make the world a better place for us but it will make a better place for the next generation behind us.
In an ideal society, we would be all organic, but knowing the amount of land and resources required to produce organic foods, I think conventional farming is the smarter of the 2.
I would say organic because of the many pros, less pesticides, maintaining biodiversity, no chemicals, etc. It's better for us and our body even though it's a bit more expensive.
organic farming is the best option because the food youre eating will be free from artificial flavors/preservatives and will be natural which is healthier.
Hamburger meat can be unsafe because of how its process of production so too much of this can be harmful even if it does provide protein. Avoiding it could lessen risk of e.coli spreading. 
I would tell my friends that the non organic food is the best option. As the video explained, most non organic farmers are using most of the same organic chemicals that organic farmers are using they are just using the bare minimum of the other non organic chemicals to increase production and sustain their yields, meaning most of the non organic food isn't actually that bad for you for a way cheaper price. Also the organic farming is bad for the environment, and with the increase of released methane can also contribute to the increased rate of greenhouse gases which is even worse for us in the long run.
I would tell my friends to try organic foods whenever possible. Buying organic can be expensive, but it's always good to try and eat more organic vegetables when you can. 
I would choose organic foods, even though they are more expensive there are a lot of reasons why they are the better option. Less chemicals and pesticides are used on organic foods. Therefore the environment around the farms are not effected or altered due to these chemicals. Also, usually when you buy organic foods they come from farms that are more local than if you bought inorganic foods. This way you are supporting the local economy.
To think fully about each decision.
I think that the best option is to cut out meat all together. Although, this isn't always as easy said then done. If someone cant cut out meat completely from their diet, I would say the next best thing would be supporting farms such as the one in the second video that is helping to limit the amount of methane gas polluting our world. 
not sure  has both view points both pros  cons 2 just one  they both have their usefulness
I would actually try and combine both ideas. Maybe we can cut back on the amount of eat we consume per week (such as having one meatless day per week) and utilize technology to eliminate the wastes that contribute to global warming. If I did have to pick one though, I lean towards the one using technology on their farm. It really is a great way to produce beef and fuel for their trucks at the same time. The whole idea of making a self sustainable farm with little to no waste appears to be more beneficial.  
organic, its healthier for you.
Organic are grass fed, have no antibiotics, and have no hormones. Try to stay away from red meats, always eat what is naturally grown like fruits or vegetables. Make sure foods are naturally raised and fresh. 
As we are college kids, I'd tell them the best option is conventional, because it will be easier for us to afford more food.
That we should not eat as much meat as we do because it is bad for the environment and is not good for our health when it is read meat like hamburgers.
Organic. Because there is no pesticides, no chemicals, maintains biodiveristy, and lower yields. 
Organic is the better option for a healthy lifestyle and I would highly recommend them to participate in eating free-range animals and more organic options. 
animal source methane fueling transportation runoff in water creating innovative solutions non animal source menthane emissions
The best option is to choose organic foods every other time that you go shopping to find a balance between the two friends and their food choices
meat contains proteins methane production greenhouse gas emissions meatless option it is better for the environment
Meat sources of protein just because we get better protein through animal protein
The overall best option, is organic food over conventional. It is the better choice for a healthy diet, because of the nutritional value provided. Conventional food includes processed food which contains pesticides and chemicals which are not good for the body. It is more convenient for people on the run to stop by a fast food restaurant or to choose the cheaper product, but with most things the cheaper option might not be the best option. For anyone, but mostly people concerned about or interested in pursing a healthier lifestyle choosing to go organic, is a great option. 
Organic because although more expensive, the less pesticides you are putting in your food the more you are helping your long term health. 
Based on what I heard in the video I would tell my friends to consume non-organic products because even though eating organic foods has a good reputation, it still has far more cons than non-organic.  Organic products are more expensive and yields less.  There is less control of minerals in soil, plus the fertilizer smells bad.  Also there are more insects due to less pesticides.  
Meatless is cheaper healthier produces less greenhouse gasses 1 meat of environmentally friendly technologies that counteract pollution
meat provides methane fueling transportation creates innovative soultions technologies can counteract pollution meatless it is a morenatural aid to the environment
I would tell my friends that we should try to buy more organic foods. Although it is more expensive, it is better to not eat as many chemicals and pesticides.
Organic because no chemicals added, maintains biodiversity and creates more jobs. 
Avoiding beef as much as possible, but doing what the farm does for what still is produced
Non Animal creates innovative solutions saves resources reduces pollution 1 animal it tastes good
meat is better for me for solving human unger better 1 vegetarian of misguided concerns
I am much more likely to tell my friends that sustainable farming is the best option.
I think that my friends could make a compromise for some foods to be organic and some can still remain conventional. Items such as chips can remain conventional and fruits and veggies can be organic.
meat option, however both is fine and is the person's decision in the end uses methane as fuel for transportation has technologies to counteract pollution creates innovative solutions 1 meatless option of the runoff water, the methane and greenhouse gas emissions
meatless runoff in water methane producton methane feuling transportation 1 animal source its their choice
I would tell my friends that the best option is organic because it is naturally grown and doesn't use chemicals or pesticides which can be harmful to the person consuming it and the environment. Organic is also better for the environment.
The best option to me, would be to choose organic because itâ€™s usually the healthiest option in most circumstances, besides with the cows and their production of green house gasses. 
Before these videos I didn't understand how toxic cow waste was to our environment. Especially saying how prominent beef is in the United States and there are cows everywhere. I would tell my friend the best option would be to try and go vegan for one meal out of the week, because one person wouldn't make a difference necessciarily but if more were to join it would go a lot better.
I would say go organic because eating meat is a great source of protein and something that has always been done. Once we take eating meat out of diets, we lose a lot of essential nutrients
I would tell my friends organic is the best choice but I personally would not pick it.
Organic because we have to be careful what we put into our bodies, and organic food has no chemicals that can hurt us. Plus, it is better for the environment.
The best option is going organic because it maintains biodiversity. It also uses less pesticides and hardly an chemicals.
Organic farming, because they cannot use conventional pesticides, it is more sustainable, and healthier as well.
It is best to choose a moderate approach. There are many costs of the hamburger and it may be harmful to a diet but if you would like to eat in moderation it is okay.
Animal Source Greenhouse gas emissions Methane production technologies that can counteract polution 1 Non-Animal Source i see different views
meatless is better for the enviroment  better for me could eventually help save some cows eating meat it taste good
Organic farming is very beneficial for the environment and it is important to note when purchasing food items compared to GMO's 
I think that a good mix between industrial style and organic style farming is a simple mix of the two. Obviously, it would he extremely harmful to the environment to purely stick to one style. Rather, we should incorporate a little bit of both for a more solid and non-destructive resolution.
Organic farming because it uses less pesticides and chemicals and maintains biodiversity
the non-animal source is better for the environment your own health better morally when  the meat option of the way they were raised and convenience in that
I would tell my friends that the best option is to try to limit beef consumption to once or twice a week maximum. Also, it would be important to try to consume meat products that come from farms that use renewable resources to help the environment.
I would tell my friends to think about the food choices that we make on the daily because they can have negative long-term effects. 
I would tell my friends to be aware of what you are eating, not necessarily to go 100% organic or conventional. 
I believe that organic farming is the best option because although it requires more work it is way more healthy for people as well as the environment. The fruit and vegetables have no pesticides on them which increase the amount of bees in the area which is good. Also using cow Manure instead of chemicals is more natural and makes the product better. 
I would say the manure being transformed into renewable gas is the best choice. I think this because this doesn't make the cow seem like the bad guy for producing so much waste, but instead make something great out of it. 
The best option is organic, if they can afford it.
Meatless because meat has more trans fat and cholesterol than plant-based protein.
I would urge people to choose conventionally grown foods. While organic foods have their benefits, the added costs don't outweigh these benefits--especially when looking at an environmental impact. In reality, we either need to improve organic or conventional farming methods so they're benefiting society and the planet at the same time.
Not to do it
conventional is not any worse for environment than organic. both have pros and cons and if less money, buy conventional.
I would recommend my friends to become an organic farmer over conventional farmer because it is the healthier option. Organic farming does not use any chemicals, which makes the produces healthy to consume. Also, organic farming usually use the wheating technique which makes it more effective. Overall, organic farming is the better way to go, even though it is pricier, it is still the better option when it comes to health. 
organic because it is overall healthier for you and has better benefits for your body.
I would tell them to go organic, because of the lack of chemicals in foods.
Sustainable farming because it is not only more humane to the animals but it is beneficial to the environment and removes the majority of the pollution used.
I would tell my friends to eat conventionally because they would save money. Eating organic is better for your body and better for the environment because it has less pesticides but at the same time it is more expensive.
meat  is beneficial to our heal for protein major contributor for containing a steady enviornment creates new innovation and technology 1 going meatless meat production makes some negative impacts in our health and enviornment.
The superior option is definitely sustainable farming in my opinion.  It maximizes the product created by cows while minimizing harmful environmental effects.  It would help reduce the damage caused by the meat industry.
Going organic is a healthier alternative, then eating non-organic. Everything organic is made straight up, and with no GMO's
Meat creates technologies nutriaents 1 Meatless hurtful
I would tell my friends that using the conventional option would be the best choice because it is more cost and energy efficient, plus it is better for the environment. 
The second one because you need to create a new thing to adapt to the new century.
to go organic because it is better for the environment 
I would tell my friedns to be mindful of the types of beef consumed if they are going to eat it. Both videos displayed pros and cons of humans cow dependencies but there's really no right or wrong. I am in support of the organic/ non-gmo beef.
meat has already been produced taste great  i'd rather it  1 meatless of health reasons
Based on what I heard in the videos I would tell my friends to choose whats best for each of them because we don't know if no chemicals or less pesticides are being used on the foods we consume, and we also don't know if conventional farming is good either. So, who am I to tell my friends what to eat and what not to eat. I'll rather let them decide for themselves so if something does happen I won't be the one to blame. 
meat option helps fuel transportation inspires new innovative ideas plus technology could counteract pollution 1 meatless option it may help limit the methane production
I would say that organic is a better option. It is better for the food that you are eating and does help the earth in some ways.
I would choose organic farming because it is a more sustainable choice. While the food may be more expensive and it may take more work, it is much better for the environment.
What is organic farming? Biology for all. throughout the video, the message holds a strong foundation as to why the increase of human population on this planet should sort to produce more organic food and to decrease the disease that comes from the soil. For instance, the video does mention the importance of crop rotation. It says that crop rotation is used to reduce diseases building up in the soils an to strengthen the soil composition. 
I think that the best option is to have industrial farming because not only is it cheaper but there are so many negatives to organic farming. There is more methane gas which is terrible for global warming, Its more expensive, and there is lesser yield. If there is lesser yield than you would have to produce way more than you would have to if you were industrial farming. More organic farming, more methane gas.
I would tell them that choosing to eat organic food relies on many different factors. They should consider these factors when deciding which food to buy / consume. Factors like: How far did the food travel to get to them? What products where used on the food? Is the food local? I would suggest to my friend to support local farms - whether they are organic or not. Buying foods from local farms reducing pollution (food doesn't have to travel long distances to get to the consumer) and it supports the local economy. 
I would use organic farming because it doesn't use chemicals on our fresh fruits and vegetables which is healthier for humans. it also provides more jobs due to the work that has to be done to make it organic. 
meat option is favorable to my own personal opinions good source of protein is natural meatless many factors in the environment and slaughter houses
meat option is easy efficient  nutrient building 1 the meatless option it may suit them better
I would tell them that the best choice is organic because it maintains biodiversity, has no chemicals in it, and far less pesticides compared to conventional food options. 
the meat option if done properly can provide methane which can be used to fuel vehicles for transportation is creating innovative solutions 1 the meatless option it is definitely the better choice for the environment, if we decided not to use sustainable energy on farms.
I think going vegetarian is the best option. It harms the Earth less
organic farming is far more beneficial to society than commercial farming.  even though organic farming takes more time, and can be more expensive, it is much more nutritious and safe than commercial products.
meatless reduces methane production  creates innovative solutions  reduces greenhouse emissions  animal-source technology
non-animal source wasteful hurtful worse animal source convenience
Organic, because I've read that chemicals and pesticides in non-organic foods can lead to cancer, including non-organic GMO crops.
I would tell my friends that while conventional farming is better for the population and sustaining food production for the upcoming years, organic farming has better results of living which can eliminate so many obstacles we face today such as illnesses from conventional pesticides, food poisoning, and other toxicity issues we encounter in America.
Animal products because they still taste good and are easily obtainable.
I would tell my friends the best option is to go organic. Although it is more expensive in the end it is much healthier for you. Not only that you are supporting local farms.
Based on the two videos, I would tell my friends about the cycle with the cows and how the famers recycle the wastes that is  used rather than throwing them away. They utilize what they have and give back to the environment. To me, I feel like this is the better option because rather than the unhealthy burgers that was in the first video, the second video shows how they use the milk and manure from cows to create their own gas which saves a ton of money. 
I think that making natural gas from cow manure is a great idea to sustain energy, since we already have so many cows in the US
Organic
After watching both videos, I can confidently say that organic and conventional farming both have their fair share of pros and cons. I think itâ€™s paramount that a balance is found. While organic farming may seem like the more environmentally friendly option, it produces a lower yield. If organic farming (which currently only makes up about 1% of farming in the world) were to replace conventional farming, a significantly larger amount of land would be required. I recognize that in todayâ€™s world, quantity often prevails over quality. In our fast-paced society, people love convenience. We are constantly looking to make things as efficient as possible. Our population has never been higher, and will only continue to grow. With that said it, it only makes sense that yield is one of the most important factors of modern farming. While globalizing organic farming is probably not a very realistic option, I certainly believe that organic farming should be a global influence. This means maintaining high levels of biodiversity and soil health. I am aware of the animal abuse that is commonplace in conventional farming. This treatment is appalling, unacceptable, and inhumane. I personally believe that treating animals with dignity and respect should be prioritized. If removing animals from dark, confined and unsanitary sheds damage yield, then so be it. While it can be easy to get up in the quest for ultimate efficiency, we canâ€™t forget about the moral/ ethical responsibilities we have as humans. To summarize, I think the most realistic option would be to continue on with conventional farming as the most dominant form of farming in the world. However, I in no way believe that the current state of conventional farming is the best it could be. Thereâ€™s plenty of room for improvement for the current treatment of the environment/ animals. Methods of sustainability need to become more widespread- not only in farming, but in all realms of this world.


I would say organic farming is the better option because it is best for the environment in the long run. Although it may not be as efficient and inexpensive as other methods, it keeps the land healthier for further use.
Don't always jump to conclusions. 
Organic farming, because they cannot use conventional pesticides, it is more sustainable, and healthier as well.
Meat option  is healthier but I don't eat red meat. more convenient  not as wasteful meatless option they think buy not eating meat every day, it will stop the overflow of beef.
I think that organic is the best option due to the fact that it is much healthier for your body. The pesticides on foods are generally not good for human health and although organic may be more expensive, it is better in terms of our long term health. 
Organic, because its better for you.
I would tell them to choose organic farming because it has many positives, and they seem to outweigh the negatives.
I would tell my friends that we should gradually start switching to organic foods, starting with fruits, vegetables, and meats. 
regular foods because organic foods are not necessarily healthier and they still use pesticides 
meat option has methane fueling transportation technologies to counteract pollution innovative solutions  the meatless option animals are definitely contributing to greenhouse gasses, but they are also a better source of protein and there are now ways to combat the overproduction of methane gas.
I believe that organic farming is the best option because although it requires more work it is way more healthy for people as well as the environment. The fruit and vegetables have no pesticides on them which increase the amount of bees in the area which is good. Also using cow Manure instead of chemicals is more natural and makes the product better. 
I would have to read more about it because I alway assumed organic farming was the best option, I do not know enough about organic farming. For instance I did not know different countries had different organic labels and that organic farming in some cases even contributes to global warming even though it increases biodiversity.  
the meat option is creating innovative solutions methane fueling transportation technologies that can counteract pollution 1 the meatless option not all farms contribute to improving the environment
yes
Organic farming seems great in theory, but the second video suggested that there are more cons to organic farming than conventional farming. So, I am not sure. I would probably say conventional farming because the cons do not seem to outweigh the pros.
Moderation of products, but do not completely boycott the industry as a whole because it would also have other consequences not explained in these videos.
I said the second video would be the best choice just caused it tell us the good side of the cows and how people use cow manure in a different but efficient way for the environment


meat  technologies can counteract pollution creating innovative soultions  methane fueling tranportation  1 meatless of water run off
Organic because it is better for ourselves and the environment
the meatless option decreases greenhouse gas emissions methane production runoff in water  1 the meat option that's what they enjoy eating and it can lead to creative innovations in technology that reduce pollution as well.
I would choose to tell them to make there own choice. Your own choice is the best and can only come back to you at the end of the day.
organic farming is the best option because it is better for the environment and the people
I would say if you can afford to eat organic, then you should.
I would tell my friends the best option is to cut down on red meat weekly. I would advise them to limit their intake on cheese, milk, and saturated fats. The $2.00 really isn't worth it, because we are paying for it in other ways. Such as the environment, and pollution that is causes. Although, there have been making scientific breakthroughs with how we handle the maneuver from animals to prevent further damage, everything helps to make us live a better life  
meatless stops greenhouse gas slows methane production stops water runoff meat it is a good source of protein and growing plants, etc. also takes up a lot of space and can be bad for the environment since the plants can kill the soil
To be honest, I am going to eat meat regardless of what happens to our bodies and everything else. I was eating it all my life and shall continue. I mean if you've been doing it, why not keep doing it
The best option is to continue practicing farm usage like the second video and focus on recycling and educating people on this issue
i would tell my friends that it would be the best option to buy organic food because it is better for you because it has no pesticides and no chemicals. 
I would say the best option is a mixture between orgainc farming and conventional farming because even though organic farming is better for biodiversity, organic farming alone is not practical and would not provide enough for the eight billion people on the planet. 
I will tell them to make the decision that's best for them. 
The second video is the best option that I would recommend my friend because there introduced a lot of benefits of cows. Not only people eat meat, some of products are also made from cow such as milk, cheese, ice cream and natural gas. 
Organic because it's more closely cared for, no additives, preservatives, or large amount of pesticides are used on the crops. It also allows for my job and puts our economy back into a sustainable state. Creating more jobs in the fields will shift the views on stratification like it used to be before the industrial revolution. I think its best if people were encouraged or even forced to  go hunt and gather for resources rather than buying them from a grocery store. I feel this way because than the human race would see the value of animals and natural resources in a new view point. In addition, it would change our amount of waste and social views. We would become less dependent on foreign trade and ultimately shift back to sustaining ourselves rather than being a power hungry economy. I think our society has lost its views on what's actually important in this world and now we are consumed by an unrealistic image of how we should look, act, maintain, perform and even grew to. I may be among the few left in this world that finds farming and nature to be beautiful and a way we should all live so that we appreciate the world around us and what its natural beauty has to offer. 
Organic options are the best because they are all natural for the body
to go organic, chemicals are the biggest part of it for me.
Sustainable farming is the  best option because it uses its own resources to grow crops, feed cows, and produce milk and produce fuel to run the trucks. It saves us from using so many resources
Conventional food is the best option because it is cheaper and maintains biodiversity
I would still recommend buying more organic than not and choose foods wisely on which companies are not only safer but also what is added to our foods. we can't always eat organic but should be aware of what is in our food
I would tell my friends it is better to not support the cattle industry after watching the first video because cows are becoming a leading cause of pollution to the earth which is already a major issue. 
Organic is best because its not only better for your health but for the environment as well
I would explain that based on healthy options organic foods will be better. They have less chemicals and that buying them could help local farms. However, I would also explain that the world will not be able to survive on organic farming alone. If we continue to try to push more towards that the worlds population could soon not have an adequate amount of food. Therefore we need to look to industries to supply adequate amounts of food for the worlds growing population. 
meat  can create innovative solutions methane fueling transportation technologies can counteract pollution 1 meatless it helps the environment in it own ways that are very beneficial as well
meat is better good 1 disagree with meat of the problems it cause to make meat
if they can buy organic products then buy it but food is food so be grateful
I would tell my friends that organic food are the best options for them because though they are a little bit more expensive it is more healthy for them. Organic foods don't have man made chemicals and have far less pesticides than conventional food. 
In my opinion the best option is to go vegan. I have been vegan for about a year now and it has been the best decision I have ever made. Not only is it ethically better, it also helps preserve our environment. The health benefits are also numerous.
For me, organic farming is still my choice. Mostly because for us consumers, it is healthier. With that being said, you waste more food then regular farming because you don't use as much chemical sprays to keep insects off of it. 
the meatless option is healthier for me better for the environment likely cheaper 1 the meat option meat is super tasty
meat option creates innovative greenhouse gas emissions runoff in water non-animal source because there is reasons for both
I would tell my friends that organic farming is the better choice to use because it is more natural and you actually know what you are buying at the super markets. Yes it is a little more expensive but it is worth getting organic healthy foods. 
I am much more likely to tell my friends that sustainable farming is the best option.
I think that organic is the best option due to the fact that it is much healthier for your body. The pesticides on foods are generally not good for human health and although organic may be more expensive, it is better in terms of our long term health. 
if they can buy organic products then buy it but food is food so be grateful
They should just buy food separately from now on. Neither of them are right or wrong they can eat the foods that they want to eat regardless of health benefits or cost. 
I think sustainable agriculture is the best option because I think that it is more realistic. The chances of Americans decreasing their consumption of hamburgers a week is not likely especially over the summer, so many American families have barbecues like its their job. Using farming techniques that protect the environment, public health, human communities, and animal welfare is a smart and easy way to help protect the environment. 
organic becasue of the health benefits. 
Sustainable farming has benefits that extend that of what we are actually consuming from fast foo places of big franchise names offering protein packed menu items. The foot print livestock leaves on the world in order to continuously provide people with meat is land consuming and often not up to par with meat regulations. I would recommend they start looking more at their local farmer markets, in order to cut back on such heavy consumption of mutated hamburgers and meats.
I would say go with your gut, maybe try to buy locally from a farmer's market a few times a month, but ultimately organic costs more and that sometimes isn't sustainable for college students. I do think that eating some organic foods is good for the environment, but nutritionally  I don't think they necessarily have more value. 
I would tell them to pick organic foods.The main reason I would tell them this is because of the harmful synthetic fertilizers that are used. If one is to be exposed to the fertilizer it can be reflected on their health negatively.
I would say that organic foods should be what everyone aims to eat because it contains less harmful chemicals and other things that conventional food has. Also, that it benefits the farmers and our agricultural system. 
Based on what I heard in the video , I would suggest for a friend to take part in Meatless Mondays or if she does choose to eat meat everyday , make sure they are from a farm and she knows where the animal was raised.
I think non-organic foods are the best option because as mentioned in the video, the sustainable population of the world is 2 billion, and right now the worlds population in 7.5 billion. Non-organic farming yields more crops than organic farming, which only uses about 1% of all land on the planet. I believe non-organic farming is a better way to feed the worlds population, although it may be a little less healthy. I do agree with the fact that organic farming uses limited pesticides and other chemicals, however, because it uses less chemicals, the yield is less which does not feed as many people. The goal of farming is to produce foods that can be used to feed large populations so, I believe it is smarter to use the method that produces more food than the method that produces "better" food. 
Vegetarianism is the best option. You can get all the nutrients you need without getting harmful side effects and diseases that occur with long term meat eating.
i would tell my friends to look up the info themselves and make their own decision. 
I believe that eating red meat is the best for you. These videos mainly talked about the processing of meat and the gasses from the poop and cow give off and effect the environment. However the second video was about a farmer and how he runs his farm and how he fixes the problems the first video was talking about. He uses the gasses produced by the poop from the cow and turned it into natural gas for your car. This gas is better for the environment and has the same power that regular gas has for your car. This was something i didn't know before and found it very interesting! Also, your body needs protein and the best source of protein is red meat. Red meat also has iron and  vitamin B12. B12 is a hard vitamin to obtain and red meat has an abundance of it. Also, red meat helps improve cholesterol levels and protects your heart. Red meat also contains omega-3 fatty acid which helps depression and anxiety. I believe the cons for not eating red meat are worse than the cons for eating red meat. Not eating red meat may lead to a vitamin deficiency of B12 which then leads to anemia. Another affect is that it may lead to nutritional deficiency. You will experience muscle wasting since your body does not have enough protein Your body also needs no less than 20 percent of your daily calories to come from healthy fat sources such as lean red meat. Otherwise, the risk of other dietary deficiencies will increase. Just like everything else, eating to much of anything is bad for you. If you have a controlled diet of consuming the right amount of red meat, your body will remain healthy.  
Though I am completely for helping the environment, I am also a realist and with that being said I would advise my friends the best choice would be inorganic foods. As was stated in the video, to have organic farming would require a mass amount of water and land that would not be possible to obtain. Organic farms also require a lot of work from farmers themselves because although some chemicals can be used they rarely are. Pesticides get into the plants causing farmers to have to start over many times. All in all, organic seems like a great idea but realistically it would not happen. 
meatless option creates innovative technology stops pollution stops green house gas emissions 1 meat option of methane fueling transportation.
The conventional farming technique seems to be a better choice than organic. Organic farming tends to require more land usage and more water. This leaves a negative impact on our planet. It is also said that cows burp more methane when wandering on organic farms than conventional. This increases our planets global warming issue. Even with the pros and cons of organic versus conventional farming, I would lean towards telling people conventional farming is more realistic. 
I believe conventional farming is better than organic because organic food is a luxury the world cannot afford right now
In terms of efficiency and environment, non-organic can be done quicker, cheaper, with less resources used. In terms of health, organic foods tend to be healthier. 
Sustainable farming would be the better option so that we can preserve our environment and use food and resources wisely.
i would tell my friends about weeding. Even though it requires the most labor, this allows people to have jobs. It also doesn't involve chemicals. I feel like it has the most positive outcomes. 
I would say organic because it's cheaper.
Non animal source Helps polution are more organic benefits the body more 1 Animal source  Protein is essential
try to eat less meat and dairy products 
I would tell my friends to try and eat less meat. Meat seems to cause a lot of problems in the world and I think if we all decided to eat less meat then we could better the world. A person does not have to completely stop eating meat in order to help, but even just not eating meat for one day could help. 
As I am relatively impartial on the topic, I would tell my friends to make a pro/con list, or maybe buy half organic half conventional groceries. For myself, I would eat more and suggest to buy more organic foods than conventional, as the price is the only downside to organic foods.
I would personally tell my friends to eat less meat and cheese per week. This is the better option for many reasons, especially because meat has greater amounts of saturated fats and therefore you could benefit from not eating as much of it. Along with this, you will still be able to help the "cycle" shown in the second video by allowing natural gas to be produced, but you will be creating less of the "bad" gas mentioned in the first video.
meatless option is healthier  less expensive better for you 1 meats it taste good
I would tell my friends that the best choice would be conventional just because it lends itself to more yields, but to look for conventional products that employed some organic methods.
I would tell my friends that actual meat is better, simply because I don't believe in eating meatless meat.
 I would tell my friends to not eat meat three times a week and instead only have it once a week because of its negative effects on both the environment and on our bodies. 
organic foods because they benefit the body more. While they are more expensive, they give the body the proper natural nutrients that it needs
I'd tell my friends that that sustainable farming is the better option. Because it is the more likely to happen fewer people you have to convince.
I would say organic farming, thinking about the long term effects on our environment and population.
In my opinion conventional farming because based on the videos you pay more for organic foods when really their farming process is only slightly better than conventional farmed foods.
meat is better for me for solving human unger better 1 vegetarian of misguided concerns
Conventional farming is better than organic because it is more affordable and both organic and conventional use pesticides so there is not too much of a difference. If all farms were organic there would not be enough product to support the population due to the fact that organic farming uses more land therefore conventional farming is necessary. Scientists are also still debating whether or not organic is healthier for you therefore as of right now there is no proof that organic is healthier than conventional. 
meatless gas emissions methane production runoff 1 meat it tastes good
organic because you dont want chemicals in your body
My choice would be organic because there is less pesticides even though there can be some, and no chemicals 
I would tell my friends to eat prouducts with chicken , tofu and alternatives to beef because the process to get the meat from the beef is a lot more strenuous than one would think. The amount of energy that is put into attaining the meat is way more than that of chicken. ALso, the waste products of cows are much more of that humans and they leave nitrous oxide pollution in the world. Also, ecoli is very readily spread through beef, so it can contaminate several hamburgers very quickly.
I think that Organic options are the best option. I think that it is better to include organic produce so the chemicals dont affect you so directly. I know that some foods such as bananas are okay to eat organic (because of that large peel). I think that if you don't choose organic you should be conscious about the non organic options.
To not eat caged meat.
I would tell my friends that eating organic meal choices can benefit more than non-organic due to the freshness and quality of the food. They also contain fewer pesticides and are better for the environment. I would consider eating organic foods more often.
I feel organic crop farming is still the best option because it is better for the environment and creates jobs. More regulation on pesticides needs to occur though. I feel non organic animal farming is okay as long as it is regulated. Animals should not be fed antibiotics and their waste needs to be converted into energy.
to eat meat


I would explain to my friends exactly what organic farming is before making them pick and choose. Organic Farming is indeed this type of farming that's suppose to be good for the environment but like anything else in the world it has it's pros and cons. I would list the pros and cons and typically weigh each option hand and hand to see which one is less harmful and more beneficial for a greater cause. Everything organic isn't all good. Organic products indeed are luxuries that the world can't afford as a whole. Although, organic farming is a natural alternative it simply causes problems that lead up to global warming issues. So with everything being said I'd evaluate the best option in the situation in this sense picking the side against organic farming because although its a great alternative it also causes problematic issues for the environment. 
organic farming because there are more jobs
I would tell my friends to buy organic products because that is what I have always eaten and my family gets.
I would choose to only eat organic because although it is more expensive, you know that everything that is going into your body is meant to be in it. There is no outside chemical that is entering your body that shouldn't be there.
I would say organic eating is the way to go because its 100% better for you body and the environment. 
Organic, if you look at it in a larger perspective it is better for the environment and it is safer without all those pesticides and fertilizers used to grow it.
I think organic because you know where it comes from. Also organic foods are all natural and have no chemicals in the food like some of the food that is conventional. It may be expensive but it is the healthier alternative.
Honestly, I can't tell you what is good and what is not. It is up to the person what they want to do with their body and what they want to put in it. 
I would tell my friends to eat organic but to still clean and wash fresh fruit and vegetables. 
I would tell my friends that food grown from sustainable farming is the best option because it is better for you and the environment.
To think fully about each decision.
meat option has ways to counteract the pollution it causes is a big money industry tastes better   meatless less cows would make it so there is less pollution
organic foods are a luxury the world cannot afford to provide if for no other reason than the amount of land it takes
meat has technologies to counteract pollution methane fueling  creating innovative solutions meatless pollution
Organic farming is the better because this process does not contains chemicals or other added supplements to the foods we are eating. 
I would tell my friends organic foods can be better than non organic. Organic foods are sustainable, better for the environment, and use no chemical pesticides or additives in animals. It can be more expensive and take more work, but the payoff is very beneficial. I think organic farming will grow in popularity once more people realize the health benefits and the benefits for the environment.
Choice 1 seems the most logical
I would tell my friend that the best option is, non organic food because although we assume organic food to always be better for us, there are many cons that come along with it. To begin, the yields from organic farming are far less than that of non organic, which than makes the price of organic food much more expensive. Also, organic dairy farm produce a lot more methane than non organic farms because of the diet of the cows. The cows waste products are detrimental to our environment. Lastly, farmers have less control of the minerals that are put into soil , and with this, there are more insects and bees that swarm the produce. 
The best option is the sustainable farming techniques. I felt like the first video made a few valid points but overall was a big stretch for the point it was trying to make. The hidden costs for cows/beef is clearly shown but relating that to pollution was a stretch. There are many other businesses with hidden pollutants the meat market is just one of them.  
I would tell them to make their own decision, using the materials I just watched. 
I would tell my friends The hidden cost of meat and I will also tell them how to fix the world and how by just simply taking one burger away a week could do so much difference in the world and the reason why I would tell them that is because not only will it make the world a better place for us but it will make a better place for the next generation behind us.
A balance between both. Support small organic farms when it comes to fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables but not rely only on those types of food since it does leave a mark on our planet.
I am personally vegan so I always share the benefits of a plant based diet. Or atleast list the benefits of heavily cutting back on meat consumption. For health and environmental reasons. 
conventional because you can be healthy without having to buy more expensive foods
Organic becuase now a days we are using way too many chemicals in food that we do not often know we are digesting and should not be eating. 
The organic farm is the best option that I would tell my friends. It is because from the organic farm, you can eat all organic foods that will be good for our health. Organic farm produces fresh food without using chemical. Although organic foods would cost more expensive, as well as using more natural materials than conventional food, we can ensure a good quality and safety products. Besides that, the less chemical we use to produce foods, the more way we and protect environment against pollution. 
I would tell them to continue eating meat because it is tasty and you only live once. None of the other stuff matters.
I would tell my friends that eating organic meal choices can benefit more than non-organic due to the freshness and quality of the food. They also contain fewer pesticides and are better for the environment. I would consider eating organic foods more often.
The best option his to think everything through first. 
For the college atmosphere I would choose inorganic, but in a general life situation I would push going organic with my friends. It leads to a healthier life, and, although you have to do a little more work for it, will be more beneficial in the long run.
To go with their gut and whatever feels right.
To go meatless
Organic, its the best quality food and will contribute best to a good healthy diet. 
going organic is the best option
Organic because it is better for your health.
Meatless  highly effective drastic  timely  1 Meat  it's good and important
i would tell my friends that although organic farming may sound better for the environment and its consumers, in reality it is not. organic farming is said to use no pesticides and be better for the environment. while what conventional farming is the way to go. although conventional farms may use pesticides, they are not hurting the environment any more than it has been. in fact they are adapting ways to conserve the soil and protect the land.
I would tell my friends to eat organic but to still clean and wash fresh fruit and vegetables. 
I would say go organic because eating meat is a great source of protein and something that has always been done. Once we take eating meat out of diets, we lose a lot of essential nutrients
I think organic farming is the best option, because it utilizes all the materials and resources while minimizing the amount of toxins and pollution as a result. 
I woud tell my friend that the best option would be organic farming. While it takes much more work and is more difficult than regular farming, organic foods are healthier for humans to consume. These foods have more nutritional value and they are free of GMOs while also not being harmful to the planet. The main con to organic farming would be that is it a lot more expensive, but in the long run I believe organic farming is the better option. 
eating organic foods is the best option because it is healthier and more regulated


I think organic food is the best option as long as one can afford it, it is worth it. 
meat tastes great can be healthy for you adds a wider variety of food 1 meatless option of inorganic food
I will tell them that organic is better, but if they don't have money to buy it, that it's fine.
Eliminate beef completely from your diet, because you can easily get protien from other sources without all the negative effects.
I would tell my friends to choose the non organic option because to me, it is the better option. Although organic foods are healthier and better for someone, and gives more job opportunities, in the long run, the non organic foods are better for the environment. There is not enough space to grow the organic foods on the earth, especially with the growing population. If we were to make more room for organic farms, we would have to cut down rain forests or something along the lines, which is environmentally bad.  
I would have to read more about it because I alway assumed organic farming was the best option, I do not know enough about organic farming. For instance I did not know different countries had different organic labels and that organic farming in some cases even contributes to global warming even though it increases biodiversity.  
To lower your beef consumption and think of grass fed beef as an alternative
Organic, because its better for you.
Definitely organic because I believe it is better for your overall health
I would say that the sustainable farming would be the best option, due to the fact that they use a more economic way, turning the  manure into a natural gas. 
I would tell them to be mindful of the types of organic farms that their foods come from, for instance be sure if they use pesticides that they are natural and not harmful. I would tell them to not neccessarily think that organic means great for the enviorment.
Organic because they are generally healthier food.
Though I am a meat eater, I believe that the first choice about reducing the amount of meat being consumed would be the best choice. Not only is the amount of meat consumed bad for the environment, it is also bad for a person's health. Though it will take me a while, I plan on reducing the amount of meat I consumer on a daily basis.
I would tell my friends it is better to eat food that is raised organically, because it avoids using harmful pesticides and unnatural growth hormones. 
meat produces methane creates innovative solutions methane fueling transportation 1 meatless it is harming the animals
eat health!
I would tell my friends that organic foods are the best option, because they are produced with no chemicals, less pesticides, and lower yields compared to conventional foods.
based on what I have heard i would tell my friends that going organic is better.  it is essentially healthier but its more expensive
After watching the two videos, I was more convinced with the second one. The farm is a great way to begin with reducing pollution. I believe that this is the best way to reduce waste because the people will not change their eating habits.
I would tell my friends that eating organic is the best choice because despite it being more expensive, there are less pesticides and chemicals in the food. 
You have to pick and choose which companies you buy your meat or milk from. Cows can be harmful to the environment, but only if you support those companies that aren't farming sustainably. Yes, you can find other sources for the protein, but what happens to those companies that are benefiting the environment and are trying to take care of us?
I would tell them to do whats best for them.
I would tell them organic because it will benefit their health and provide the proteins their body needs.
To eat healthy natural food to prolong a healthy life
Based on the videos I watched, in the first video there was a fact stated that Americans have started to eat more tofu, turkey and chicken rather than ground beef.  This is the best option because tofu, turkey and chicken is still giving our bodies the sources of protein we need and they're so much better for us.
I would tell my friend that it would be best to reduce their amount of meat intake. However, with meat being very abundant in American's diet, learning how to lessen the effects of the mass production of meat might be a better option. 
I would tell my friends to chose organic farming. Although it is harder to keep up with, it can still be healthier than regular farming because of levels of pesticides. 
I would tell my friends conventional farming is best because I believe it is the most convenient and affordable for most people.
The best option is to go organic as it uses less pesticides,  no chemicals, and maintains biodiversity
Organic, because it is better in the long run for our health and the environment we live in. 
I would say natural organic farming is a lot better. Even though it's a lot of labor it is better for the environment and for your self 
meatless option  greenhouse gas emissions methane production runoff in water 1 meat option it can be very difficult to change your everyday lifestyle.
I would say that organic is the way to go. I say this because it is better for the environment because there are no chemicals used and pesticides aren't being used. Also organic farming promotes a sustainable environment. Organic farming reduces pollution as well. 
Organic farming is the better alternative to commercial farming in theory, but commercial farming uses less resources and yields more and is the better option.
Organic. No chemicals, less pesticides, overall better option.
I would show them the second video because it shows how it may be good to use organic food, but it comes with some cons. Which I feel would show both sides on deciding what type of food to buy.
Organic farming is probably better than the two because it is better for consumers even though it is more expensive. 
I think the best option is sustainable farming because I think it is better for the environment.  It takes up less land and produces less methane in the air.  I think sustainable farming will help the earth last longer, less methane means the slower the temperature will rise and by not needing as much land we would not have to cut down more trees which means more oxygen.  No where in the video did i hear it mention that organic food has been proven to be better, I think they are equal in nutrition and sustainable farming is the way to go.    
I wouldn't tell my friends that one is better than the other, I would just inform them about each and the pros/cons that coincide with both sides. So, based on that, I would focus more on the pros that organic faming and eating has. I think a big aspect that attracts organic consumers is the fact there are no chemical and less pesticides used while farming. It is also understandable that the cost factor may limit consumers to choose certain products, but due to the way that organic farmers produce, upkeep and maintain their food, I can see why organic prices would be higher.
meatless option reduces greenhouse gas emissions reduces methane production reduces runoff in water the meat option they like meat
Based on what I heard in the videos, its not really "better" to buy organic food.  is it healthier, yes but they still can us gmos.  I think that the best option is to buy some of your products organic and some not, that way it's not too expensive to take on.
Based on what I heard in the videos, I would suggest to a friend to start eating green in order to help improve sustainability of our planet. 
I would tell them to be mindful of the types of organic farms that their foods come from, for instance be sure if they use pesticides that they are natural and not harmful. I would tell them to not neccessarily think that organic means great for the enviorment.
organic, because it is is better for the environment in the long run. Less pesticides, no chemicals, and maintenance of biodiversity are all important factors to keep growing food for years to come. 
I would tell my friends that organic farming might sound appealing at first, but in truth, it is a luxury we as a planet can't afford right now. It is proven that organic farming reacquires a lot more water than regular farming methods utilize. For example, organic milk will take up 80% more land. As stated before, organic products take more water and as droughts become more regular today, it is a resource that we can't waste. Furthermore, organic farming also it makes it difficult for farmers to keep control of the mineral content in the soil because manure is used (pungent odor). If someone was to farm organically, that would mean having to weed crops by hand one at a time. It's not only time consuming, but labor intensive. It said that the food produced by organic farmers is ‰ÛÏa healthier product‰Û, but organic is just another word for expensive. In conclusion, the main question here is, does organic farming have the power to sustain a population of 7.5 billion? The answer is no. Hence, organic farming is not the perfect solution. 


I would tell my friends that neither is the better option. I highly doubt that organic food consumption is going to sky-rocket, however they can feel free to eat whichever kind of food that they want. Sure, it is cheaper to eat conventional food, but if they can feel free to pay the up-charge for organic foods.
Organic foods are farmed, or are grown without the use of artificial chemicals, hormones, or other modified organisms. I would tell my friends that the best option is organic foods. they may contain more nutrients than non-organic foods. 
I would say that the best option is to go with grass fed cows or anything that comes from a sustainable farm if they are going to eat red meat because it is better for the environment. Just cutting down on how much you eat or where you get it from make a huge difference. 
I would suggest we choose conventional product, because we do not have it is not wise to invest more money in a product that will also create negative factors.
I would explain that based on healthy options organic foods will be better. They have less chemicals and that buying them could help local farms. However, I would also explain that the world will not be able to survive on organic farming alone. If we continue to try to push more towards that the worlds population could soon not have an adequate amount of food. Therefore we need to look to industries to supply adequate amounts of food for the worlds growing population. 
Despite the possible larger carbon footprint that organic dairy farming can give off, I would suggest buying organic. The debate is still going on whether or not the food is more healthy, but these farmers are putting in more effort and time to try and help the environment and provide you with more fresh and healthy food. I would suggest trying to find organic produce that does not use artificial fertilizers and pesticides. 
I would tell them to try to do research on the specific company doing the organic farming to determine whether or not their practices are done in such a way that paying more for their produce is truly worth it.
I would tell my friends that both of them are right in part, but that they should both do some research concerning the other point of view. Organic farming is a great practice in theory but cannot sustain the ever growing population, but that also doesn't mean it is everything it claims to be. Do the research, and make the best decision for themselves.
I would tell them that plant based protein is the best option
meatless option is better healthier 1 meat option its what they grew up eating
meatless  is healthier better for the environment more humane meat option  it is easier to get
not sure greenhouse gas emissions runoff in water methane gas meatless it
The video suggest that organic eating is so much better for you body because their arent any pesticides  that may be harmful to your health in the future. Also we dont really know if things that are GMO are actually harmful to humans yet because its such a new sciance
While it may not be the most cost efficient, it has less pesticides and herbicides. This makes it healthier than conventional products. Also as the yield is low paying the little extra money can help the farmers tremendously.
I would say the organic is the best option for them because it is not chemical induced like the machine foods are. It also maintains a diversity.
The best option is to continue practicing farm usage like the second video and focus on recycling and educating people on this issue
I would tell my friends that organic farming sounds better but has just as many cons - give or take a few - as conventional farming. So choose to eat whatever you want.
I would tell my friends that organic food is the best option because it has no chemicals, less pesticides, and maintains biodiversity. The health benefits of eating locally grown, organic food are tremendous.
I would tell my friends to go with organic farming because it is going to be beneficial in the years to come. Although it is more tideous for the farmers, they can make more profit to produce more of it. 
To just go with inorganic because it truly is not always the best decision
It would be a hard one, because both provide good information. Although I would go with the first video, because if more people can learn about the excess gas released by the large amount of cattle being raised can be helpful. Which could lead to people eating less cattle and maybe reduce some of the amounts of green house gasses. 
As a passionate environmentalist, I would choose organic farming.
become organic
After watching these two videos, this is a difficult question for me to answer. I believe that the best option is for us to eat foods that come from an organic farm; however, I don't believe this is the best option for our environment. I am truly torn on which is the best option considering the pros and cons to both, but if I have to answer I would tell my friends that conventional farming is the better option as a whole. 
Meatless option reduces runoff in water methane production greenhouse gas emissions 1 the meat option there are pros to this side as well
I would choose organic because you know exactly where it came from and how it was produced. 
The conventional farming technique seems to be a better choice than organic. Organic farming tends to require more land usage and more water. This leaves a negative impact on our planet. It is also said that cows burp more methane when wandering on organic farms than conventional. This increases our planets global warming issue. Even with the pros and cons of organic versus conventional farming, I would lean towards telling people conventional farming is more realistic. 
I would say the best, most realistic option would be to make our farms more sustainable. However to make an impact on an individual scale, it would be best to cut down on beef consumption.
Organic foods are better because they use less pesticides and there are no chemicals
I would choose conventional because it maintains biodiversity, it has higher yields, it is less expensive and more efficient. I can see the other side because organic tries to use methods of crop rotation and less pesticides to make their crop sustainable
meatless has less potential side effects for my mental state physical state 1 meat option it is a different and common source of protein
Choose organic when you can because it is better for the environment, but always choose vegan food because it is better for the environment, your health, and the animals.
I would say the use of organic farming. Since organic food production avoids the use of chemicals, it doesn't show any risk of soil and underground water contamination, unlike the other farming
I would tell my friends it is up to them. Either if they care more about their body or about the earth and how much money they would like to spend on the healthier choice. Of course there are some downsides with organic but there is always down sides to every produce on the market. 
The best option would be taking all of the cow manure produced and turning it into renewable energy to power trucks and other buildings.  
I think that we should stay how we are eating because although organic food has less chemicals it is more expensive and is not practical for a college student budget.
Go organic because of chemicals, pesticides and biodiversity.
To just go with inorganic because it truly is not always the best decision
I would tell my friends that organic is the better option because it helps the environment by using fewer chemicals and pesticides.
I feel that option 1 is the best choice. This is because it is the most environmentally friendly option overall.
Based on what I heard in the videos, I would tell my friends that conventional farming is the best option moving forward, simply because organic farming would take too long and require too much untouched land.
I feel organic crop farming is still the best option because it is better for the environment and creates jobs. More regulation on pesticides needs to occur though. I feel non organic animal farming is okay as long as it is regulated. Animals should not be fed antibiotics and their waste needs to be converted into energy.
I would say no organic. I would rather be able to feed more people rather than having to find more land to create the same amount of food. 
Although I agree with organic being the better choice for the environment, I would say conventional because money is tight during college and we need money for books and classes more than organic food
Based on what I heard in the video , I would suggest for a friend to take part in Meatless Mondays or if she does choose to eat meat everyday , make sure they are from a farm and she knows where the animal was raised.
meatless healthier environment  gas emissions 1 meat protein
type here
That all the cow waste and everything else  is hurting our climate.
I would say the best option is truly up to you and your lifestyle. If you're going to eat meat, then just be sure that it is a good quality meat, and do not go overboard with it. 
Based on what I heard in the videos, I would tell my friends that organic farming is more detrimental than it is helpful. The foods are more expensive, take longer, and do not yield as many products. This is a problem, as our population continues to grow every year. In addition, organic farming uses up much more land than industrial farming which is very harmful for the environment and causes more issues. Lastly, it costs more money because more workers are needed. 
I would tell them to continue eating meat because it is tasty and you only live once. None of the other stuff matters.
To remain organic because it helps the environment. You don't have to become completely meatless to make a small difference.
Personally I would tell my friends that nonorganic is the best option. I don't believe that the chemicals make all that detrimental of an effect on out health and nonorganic is significantly cheaper. Keeping in mind that we are all in college, if all our parents never ate organic food and are still fine now, hopefully we will too. Also, organic farming can't sustain the world. Regular farming can't sustain it either, but there's at least a greater, faster, and more consistent output of food.
Cows hold much importance in the U.S. even though they produce large amounts of greenhouse gasses the use of their manure as fuel helps to reduce the amount of gas used. Cows are very versatile with their uses ranging from milk and meat production to transportation and other services.
Organic farming is what I would choose, because we only have one earth. Industrial farming is done simply because it's easy and convenient. If we put the same amount of time and energy into learning how to improve organic farming as we do with industrial farming, we'd have new convenient easy ways to farm while also helping the environment. Yes, it yields less, there's pesticides, it's harder to do, etc. But we could use the technology we have now to fix these problems. 
Based on what I viewed, I believe that organic farming is still a better option because you're not using any chemicals and farmers have to find natural ways to produce our food. It is better for the environment even though you're generating small yields. 
I would tell my friends to eat organic because it is overall better for the body, using pesticides and chemicals is bad for your health and there is no reason to be consuming them.
I think that a drastic decision either for ALL organic or ALL conventional farming is neither good for the environment or good for the human population. I believe that a balance is in order. There are positives an negatives of both conventional and organic farming, so instead of choosing the best of two evils I think that we should do half and half. 
Organic foods because it makes more sense and it keeps you alive longer.
The best option is to eat meat that is preferable for you. As long as you have enough evidence to support your decision you should be fine.
Personally, I would tell my friends that eating meat and consuming dairy products has a much bigger impact on the environment then they think. The video that was able to convert fertilizer to energy is extremely interesting but I still believe the overall cost of consuming animal products is wrong. I personally, don't eat meat or dairy, and have been a vegan for 2 years - so perhaps i'm biased. However, I do believe people need to start thinking about the impact their food has on their bodies and the environment. 
Continuing to eat meat because it is good for you and you need to eat it in order to survive. 
I would tell them that the best choice is organic because it maintains biodiversity, has no chemicals in it, and far less pesticides compared to conventional food options. 
The best option is organic farming because it maintains biodiversity and does not use chemicals.
I would tell my friend that they can purchase organic foods if they want because that is there decision. Although, I would tell them that there might not be as large as a difference between organic and conventional as they think.
I would tell my friends organic farming is the better option because it has much less additives and pesticides that are harmful to people. Although it requires more work and land, I feel that it is worth the extra effort. I personally feel that I would rather eat foods that were grown in a more natural way even if means paying slightly more. I think that organic foods are much healthier in the long run and we can avoid many diseases by consuming organic foods. Although it may be more difficult to produce and care for the organic foods, I think that it is all worth it in the end and therefore the better option. 
Based on the videos, I would tell my friends that sustainable farming, as demonstrated by Fair Oaks Farms, is the best option. The filtration process they use in order to convert cow manure to gas for their vehicles prevents them from having to use diesel. Their method of recycling the methane gas that comes from cow manure is a great way to decrease that methane gas from spreading into the atmosphere. If more farms copied this technique, it can make a large impact in our environment and reduce climate change. 
I think conventional farming with organic farming aspects is the best option.
I would tell her to eat organic food a couple of times a week. Even though they are pricey, it is better for the environments because it uses less pesticides. 
Based upon the videos, I wouldn't recommend my friends to consume any type of beef or meat. Just seeing what these animals are put through just to produce food for us is enough to make me steer away from consuming it. 
Eating organic food is a good lifestyle change to make, but it is not something that needs to be done in order to be healthy. 
I would tell my friends to buy organic because there are no chemicals and less pesticides, and even though it may be a bit more expensive, if it is healthier for your body, it is worth it
Organic, its healthier and better for the environment. if they can afford to eat organically, I believe they should try. 
I would tell my friends that organic is the best option for their own personal bodies, as it eliminates the usage of harsh chemicals. But, I would also advise them of the downfalls of organic farming, and suggest starting at a local farm and buying fresh produce there, if they are wary of organic farming.
I would say at the given time non-organic production is best otherwise we would have no way to feed the 8+ billion people in the world. That by no way means we should not look for ways to increase crop yield while also decreasing harmful things like chemicals and pesticides in the future. It's a fine balance that must be found. 
meatless option  is better creates pollution destroys our environment  meat option in the long run we are killing humans by not producing quality live stock
meat makes meathane tech fule meatless it polluts
Sustainable farming because most Americans won't want to make dietary changes.
I would tell them that the person buying organic food should be allowed to make that choice, but should instead buy their own groceries and keep their food to themselves to prevent housemates for under/overpaying.
non-animal source methane production greenhouse gas emissions runoff in water 1 alternative option in order to consume more protein and vitamins for their survival
I would tell my friends that the best option is meatless sources. In video 2, they explained how milk, then manure to be used as fuel. Then crops are able to be grown. Its a better cycle.  
To eat as organic as possible and mostly fresh fruit and vegetables. When we eat meat its harder for our bodies to digest and processed foods are hard as well.
I would choose organic farming because it is a more sustainable choice. While the food may be more expensive and it may take more work, it is much better for the environment.
i would tell them that eating healthy is the most important step you're going to take in your lifetime. the video did an excellent job of detailing those out 
Organic foods are the best option for your body
meatless greenhouse gas animal pain land 1 meat it's good
ill tell my friend to figure it out himself
meat solves methane transport greenhouse gas emissions that methane won't be made much 1 the meatless option of how it's made
Eliminate beef completely from your diet, because you can easily get protien from other sources without all the negative effects.
conventional farming. it is more practical in our growing population and does not necessarily cause much more of a footprint when considering global warming
I would say eat as healthy as possible. Try to mix in veggies and non GMO proteins for a balanced diet. 
The organic option is better for ones health and environment. Although it is more expensive, in the long run it makes more sense.
I think the mix of conventional and organic farming is the best. It will help use as little land as possible while still protecting biodiversity and soil composition.
I don't think organic farming is viable in this day and age. Like the narrator mentioned, many people like organic food because they believe that it is better. It stood out to me that the narrator said believe instead of saying that it is better for you. While people were able to sustain themselves with organic farming prior to the industrial revolution, that was only because there were so much fewer people. The maximum capacity that an environment can have eventually levels out, but, with humans, technological advances allow us to grow beyond our habitat's natural max capacity. Just because organic farming is how it used to be done and can be seen as more pure than farming today, doesn't mean that it is better. Technology advances the way it does to help humanity; going backwards won't often yield better results.
Meat Option Methan production Methane fueling transportation Creating innovative solutions 1 Meatless option it is a more healthier option
meatless provides benefits for the environement diet  lifestyle 1 meat of the convenience
I would probably tell them to make organic choices when they can but to keep in mind that organic is more expensive and I would inform them of the pros and cons.
Meat Option has tech that can counteract pollution made meat taste good why not? to have a vegan diet of their health
I would tell my friends to choose organic food because it is the easiest for the body to digest and comes from all natural/ non- artificial sources. 
I think the best option choice is organic farming foods because its a more natural alternative, the product is healthier because less chemical is used on them and it's more friendly with the environment. 
I would tell them I wouls agree most with managing our resources in a way that would be the easiest for our earth to handle, this would ensure food for all of the 7 billion people and an earth that can be sustained over time. 
I would tell that organic is a better option in the long run. Organic food are locally grown from a reliable source where as grocery store food is sent to a factory to be sprayed with chemicals to add a better taste. In the long run people will pick the fresher tasting food over the chemical food. 
I would tell my friends to choose organic foods because they are not only healthier for the body, but better for the environment than conventional foods.
I would recommend my friends to become an organic farmer over conventional farmer because it is the healthier option. Organic farming does not use any chemicals, which makes the produces healthy to consume. Also, organic farming usually use the wheating technique which makes it more effective. Overall, organic farming is the better way to go, even though it is pricier, it is still the better option when it comes to health. 
i think organic still, just because it seems to be still the healthier option. 
I would say the best option is to eat meat. Meat is the best source of protein and also a good source for iron, vitamin B, and energy. Although eating meat does of cons, these cons are mainly based on if you eat to much red meat which is true for anything. If you eat to much of anything, it is bad for you. These videos talked mainly about the processing method and how it is hurting the environment and the bad gases the cows and their poop give off. However, the second video was about a guy telling you about his farm and he had a way to fix most of the problems the first video was talking about. The major one was the gases from the cows poop. He was using their poop to make gas for your car which is an all natural gas and so much better for the environment and has the same power that regular gas has. I found this very cool and interesting, I had no idea this even existed! Red meat is a complete protein which contains all the essential amino acids and saturated and monosaturated fats that have been shown to improve cholesterol levels. so eating red meats protects your heart. Also red meat contains omega-3 fatty acids which are protective against anxiety and depression, so eating red meat gives you energy and puts you in a happy mood. I believe that the cons for not eating meat is a lot worse than cons for eating meat. One con is the risk of vitamin deficiency. B12 is a hard vitamin to find and is mainly found in animal sources such as red meat. If you don't get enough of this vitamin, you may develop anemia. You may also experience weight loss or muscle wasting if dies does not contain enough protein. Even though losing weight may be a good thing, less than 20 percent of your daily calories come from healthy fat sources which red meat contains. In the end, I believe eating the right amount of red meat is a good and beneficial thing. 
Going organic is a waste of time, eat anything and everything.
meat  makes pure methane makes the fuel for transportation makes a lot of water for animals meatless option eating a lot of meat could potentially cause harm to you body
Non- Animal source struggles with methane productin Greenhouse gas emissions damages Methane fueling transportation eating meat it tastes good
I would tell them to do whats best for them.
i would tell them to watch the first video because it gives really important facts 
I believe that eating conventional is fine because it is less expensive 
both may cause runoff water can create methane fueling transportation made from maneur creative alternatives may be designed 1 either one both contain strong points
I would tell them that it is best if they were to go organic if they still wanted to eat meat simply for the fact that the producers are trying to keep up with the need of meat and it is causing them to inject the animals with a chemical that is bad for you to eat and it can cause damage to your body without you even knowing overtime. It is best to cut out meat in general but, if you just have to have it make sure that it is completely natural. 
I would tell my friends that buying organic foods is the better choice.  Although the organic foods are more expensive, there are less pesticides added to the plants and it maintains biodiversity.  Organic foods ensure a healthier environment and population.  
I would tell them to ask politely if they could just pay for their own organic food and you pay your own food since you don't eat that type of food so you shouldn't have to pay more. 
Reducing their amount of beef intake to help prevent pollution in the environment because the more beef we eat, the more cows are needed to meet that demand creating more pollution. 
I would tell my friend that it would be best to reduce their amount of meat intake. However, with meat being very abundant in American's diet, learning how to lessen the effects of the mass production of meat might be a better option. 
vegetables  healthier safer environmental friendly  meat it ruins environment
Since they are in college and most people don't want to pay more, I would say not using organic products is fine. 
i would tell my friends eating healthy is very important in anything you do 
Eating organic is the best choice because it is pure.
I think I would tell my friends about the second video because i feel like it is more educational and provided a more positive tone. I like how the second video was informing on ways to make the manure into something very useful instead of just polluting the earth.
Organic because it is much better for us to consume and free of GMOs and chemical pesticides 
Organic food is no doubt the healthier more beneficial food type to choose but from personal experience i would say non organic would be the tastier food choice, and has the ability to be somewhat healthy for you.  
Sustainable farming because the techniques they use protect the environment, public health, human communities, and animal welfare.
Neither one seems to be better than the other so choose which you think is best. 
I honestly have a hard time with this topic, because both have its pros and cons but I would have to choose option two because I think that is the most efficient.
Based on what I heard in the two videos, I would tell my friends that there are just as many pro and cons between conventional and organic farming. It's difficult to choose which is the better option because of this. If there were a more reliable source explaining each and every pro and con of them both, then it would be easier to choose. But in all honesty, almost every source that speaks of this topic is very biased. There are also no nutrient differences between the two, therefore I would tell my friends that the decision of which is better is to their own discretion. 
The best option is not going through organic farming. I feel this way because yes it is a good idea in theory but it cannot possibly sustain the 7.5 billion people on this earth because it requires too much land for not much product. For instance, the video was saying that organic milk requires 80% more land than regular milk and there is not nearly as much. 
Organic has its perks but i believe anybody can eat non organic food and it be okay.
I would tell my friend the best option is organic farming. Organic farming builds healthy soil, food is loaded with nutrients, food has a natural and better taste, there is a direct support to farming, and avoids the consumption of a lot of harmful chemicals. 


Organic because its better for you. If you take care of your body now while you're young, it will take care of you later on.
I would tell my friends to only buy organic items if they know they are safer but otherwise I would recommend regular produce as long as you check the labels and they are affordable. 
meat  creates innovative solutions technologies can counteract pollution runoff in water is important to watch 1 meatless they have valid points to argue
I would tell my friends to eat less beef and to eat mostly chicken and fish because those are meats that are easier on the body to digest and process.
non animal source  greenhouse methane methane meat food
non animal source  greenhouse methane methane meat food
I would tell my friends that organic is the best way to go because there are no chemicals involved, which are harmful to your health
Although organic farming may not produce as big of a crop yield than conventional farming, it focuses on sustainability of the environment which I believe is more important. Organic farming doesn't use chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides or feed additives for livestock. The manure produced by cows specifically is used to recycle waste and improve the soil structure. Other factors such as weeding...the preferred organic farming, may mean that it is more labor intensive but makes more jobs available‚Ä¶more economically friendly and chemical free. Overall, organic farming is the best option because it helps to maintain the biodiversity better rather than conventional farming because fewer chemicals are used. 
organic, because it is is better for the environment in the long run. Less pesticides, no chemicals, and maintenance of biodiversity are all important factors to keep growing food for years to come. 
Out of the two videos, I would tell my friends that sustainability is the best option (video 2) because you get the same results, but it is better for the environment. The first video shows the corrupt system that we as a society have created which ultimately causes green house gas pollution. Yet with sustainable farming, the milk and manure from Fair Oaks Farm in Indiana comes together in a digester to make renewable natural gas. This allows a tanker truck to deliver this milk all through the upper Midwest. Therefore, 2 million gallons of natural gas fuel is produced using this farming technique. 
Organic of course, because it is better for your body.
either option; most likely meat though is beneficial for bodily nutrients is delicious is plentiful and less costly 1 meatless of the cons
organic foods are the best route because healthier for our bodies
I would tell my friends that if they had the money they should buy organic foods because three are no chemicals, it maintains biodiversity and uses less pesticides.
Organic is healthy, however, may cost more than general foods. Organic food production is good for the environment
Organic foods is the best choice because it is significantly healthier and all around better for your health short and long term.
Even with the fact that organic foods are more expensive than conventional foods, I would recommend one to pay very close attention to what groceries they buy and where they buy them, as well as to take notes on price differences. A little research can go a long way in saving money on groceries. Farmers' markets are a great source of organic produce and tend to price their foods lower than big-name grocery stores like Walmart or Costco.
I would tell them to go organic, because it can be the healthier and safer option. usually eating organic can mean supporting a local farmer also. 
I would tell my friends to buy non-organic. At first, I thought it would be better to buy organic foods, but there are many cons. As stated in the video, organic farming uses up more resources (water, land, etc.) compared to regular farming, which can make these resources scare. 
Being an organic eater is good for some people but It is not the choice that I would make because then you have to also take supplements to keep your body vitamins in check
mealess is to less wasteful 1 meat it
Eating sustainable farmed animals. Minimal to no beef, but grass fed if anything. Better to eat some pork/poultry and more plant based foods, which produce much less or no greenhouse gases which negatively effect the environment. 
I believe it all is best in moderation, since there are also other consequences not explained in these videos to other aspects of the world.
Video 2 Because they are being environmentally friendly
Video 2, because it informs the audience about both the good and bad side of organic farming
meatless helps with less methane production less runoff water methane fueling transportation 1 meat  there are ways to prevent some of the hazards that go along with eating meat.
Based on watching these two videos on organic farming, I would tell my friend that organic farming is by far the best way.  I believe this because organic farming is more than just getting rid of pesticides and hormones, taking care of each animal in the way that they properly need is very important.  Raising animals to be in a comfortable environment helps them grow to be healthy, which is actually better when it comes to eating meats.  These animals who are raised on organic farms are the best kinds of meat because they won't be as tough.  
Organic is the best option because it involves no chemicals, less pesticides and maintains biodiversity
I would encourage them to cut back on their intake of red meat and try to get protein through other foods. I would tell them about the affects that it can have on our environment.
I would still say that conventional farming is the best option, strictly based on the worlds population. Organic farming offers less yields because pest interfere with the farming and kill or damage more of the crops because pesticides aren't being used to fend them off. Although organic farming can be a healthier option and more environmentally friendly, it is unrealistic to mass produce crops organically because they were require 80% more land and there simply isn't enough land to do so. 
meatless option is healthier safer better for the environment to eat meat is delicious
Meatless Option will help your health you will be helping the environment your weight 1 Meat Option  they love meat
Even though I do not partake in this, I believe purchasing organic foods to be the best option to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Not only is their less chemicals being used to produce the food compared to conventional foods, but organic farming helps fight global warming and support the health and welfare of plants and animals living off the foods that are in the soil.
Continuing to eat meat because it is good for you and you need to eat it in order to survive. 
I think that my friends could make a compromise for some foods to be organic and some can still remain conventional. Items such as chips can remain conventional and fruits and veggies can be organic.
Organic food refers to the way farmers grow and process products with reducing pollution, enhancing soil and water quality, and promoting a healthy living condition. However, I would say that you do not have to insist on eating organic food because it is the same with regular food nutritionally. 
I would tell my friends that the best option is to eat conventional. This is because it is a less expensive diet.  It also maintains biodiversity and has lower yields.  I can see why to go organic but the cons out weight its pros.
As a passionate environmentalist, I would choose organic farming.
Moderation of products, but do not completely boycott the industry as a whole because it would also have other consequences not explained in these videos.
Eating "green", and healthy protein! Protein is better if it is not processed because has less chemicals in it. I don't believe there is enough research to prove their negative long-term effects, but they are the worse of the two. 
organic


Organic, although it is more expensive it is better for the enviroment and better for your body
going organic is the best option
meat option creates innovative solutions methane production run off in wayer 1 meatless option it produces methane
I would tell them the first choice is the best
I would tell my friends that organic is the best option for their own personal bodies, as it eliminates the usage of harsh chemicals. But, I would also advise them of the downfalls of organic farming, and suggest starting at a local farm and buying fresh produce there, if they are wary of organic farming.
I think organic is the best since if you want to live long and naturally than organic is the best
0
Meat Greanhouse gas emission Methane fueling transportation Methane production 1 Methless it is a little more healthy to eat veggies than red meat.
organic so you aren't harming yourself
Organic is the best because it supports local farmers along with it reduces the intake of dangerous chemicals. 
I would say conventional based on the limited information given in the two videos. Organic foods don't have many benefits over conventional foods, and they may not be completely organic.
Organic, because it has no chemicals and less pesticides 
While watching the video I would recommend organic to friends because I feel like Organic food is a better way to maintain a healthy lifestyle  as well as diet. Consuming to many conventional food may be deteriorating to health because it uses chemical fertilizing. Also the pricing of Organic is more expensive because it takes a longer time to produce, and usually longer time means the better the end product. 
Organic because there are less chemicals involved
I would eat organic foods. Even though they are more expensive, they are made without artificial chemicals.
I would tell my friends about the farm that uses the byproducts of cattle to help cattle survive while producing milk and energy. The video was happy and shorter so naturally, the attention is drawn to that.
I think conventional farming is the best option because it produces high yields to sustain our population. Also, organic farming has many negative byproducts such as needing more land and water which we simply do not have because those are scarce resources. By acquiring more land it would damage the environment even more so that defeats the purpose of organic being healthy and good for everyone. Also cows produce twice as much methane gas on organic farms than on conventional farms so while trying to reduce the environmental footprint I feel like it is too late and we have already caused too much damage. Therefore, I believe we should stick with what is working which is conventional farming.
I would advise my friends to eat organically, because the health benefits of eating from an organic diet are far greater than eating with a conventional diet.
Organic is the best option in my opinion because there is no harmful chemicals and less pesticides even though it is more expensive, it is worth it in the long run for one's overall health 
I would tell my friends that the non organic food is the best option. As the video explained, most non organic farmers are using most of the same organic chemicals that organic farmers are using they are just using the bare minimum of the other non organic chemicals to increase production and sustain their yields, meaning most of the non organic food isn't actually that bad for you for a way cheaper price. Also the organic farming is bad for the environment, and with the increase of released methane can also contribute to the increased rate of greenhouse gases which is even worse for us in the long run.
Organic, although it is more expensive it is better for the enviroment and better for your body
I would go with the first option
Although it seems there are more cons than pros in organic farming, I would tell my friend that it is still the best option for our environment. It is a lot of hard work and labor, but ideas can be exchanged and projects can be made in order to make it less of a struggle. I believe that if more individuals were educated on it, more possibilities and alternatives can me formed. Organic farming helps our biodiversity, environment, and makes products that are healthier. In my opinion, that outweighs the cons. 
the best opinion for me is to continue to eat meat because it is what I am used to, but I do understand people that dont eat meat. 
I think its important to try and eat as clean as possible, we should try to avoid putting extra unknown chemicals into our bodies. 
The best option is to go vegan, because a vegan diet produces the smallest carbon footprint and leads to the least amount of human and nonhuman animal suffering. 
I would tell my friends about the second video because it goes in depth about how organic farming isn't necessarily as clean and healthy as everybody thinks it is, it is actually harmful in ways.
I would tell my friends eating organic foods is the best option because it is better for the environment and better for your health.
The best option is not feeding the cows the corn and feeding them more grass since they are big producers of methane gas and it is a huge factor of climate change over CO2 emissions.
Organic because overall the benefits outweigh the conventional benefits.
I would urge my friends to purchase all organic. Inorganic foods contain chemicals as well as other things we aren't aware of, so why put that in our bodies? 
Organic farming is healthier! it it the better option- you feel more at peace knowing your food is made in a natural way. For example, not many people know the exact list of pesticides being used during the farming process, and these could be toxic to our bodies. 
not sure  methane production runoff in water green house gas emissions both sides both sides have positives such as eating meat gets rid of the pollution and then follows up with a con of it not being that well for our health.
meatless limits runoff in water methane production greenhouse gas emmissions 1 meat it tastes better
I think that the word organic makes people think it is better, when in reality it isn't ideal. 
I would say organic farming is a better option than conventional farming because there are no pesticides, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics, or additives. There is also less harm done to the environment, which is important with so many issues with the planet as it is.
I would tell my friend sustainable farming is the better option.
I believe conventional farming is better than organic because organic food is a luxury the world cannot afford right now
For the college atmosphere I would choose inorganic, but in a general life situation I would push going organic with my friends. It leads to a healthier life, and, although you have to do a little more work for it, will be more beneficial in the long run.
Conventional farming because I believe it would be very difficult and expensive to supply a whole population with organic foods.  Also there are some environmental problems also present in organic farming.
Organic foods are the best option, however, it may not always be available to everyone. I feel that as long as people eat certain foods in moderation, they can still be healthy.
meatless is healthier better for the environment prevents greenhouse gas emissions meat it is a good source of protein
A balance between both. Support small organic farms when it comes to fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables but not rely only on those types of food since it does leave a mark on our planet.
meatless option harms our environment pollutes our water create more damage than good 1 meat options it is a quicker and efficient source of protein
One of the biggest problems currently is global warming. Conventional farming adds to this problem because it uses a lot more pesticides and tries to produce more goods faster. In order to avoid global warming from worsening I would tell my friends the best option is organic farming. This would also allow for more jobs to be created because more people are needed to weed or maintain the crops.
I would urge people to choose conventionally grown foods. While organic foods have their benefits, the added costs don't outweigh these benefits--especially when looking at an environmental impact. In reality, we either need to improve organic or conventional farming methods so they're benefiting society and the planet at the same time.
I would tell them to eat organic because it contains less pesticides and chemical, and it also maintains biodiversity.
meatless option reduces runoff in water methane production greenhouse gas emissions 1 animal sources the high source of protein
To eat healthier because its cheaper and will help your body in the long run. It takes meat a while to digest.While vegetables digest easily and live you feeling full and light.
I would tell them my opinion of the following options, not weighing or pushing them to follow me but to allow them to think how I am about the situation for a moment.


I would think that organic is the best option because even though it is more expensive, it will still be beneficial for your healthy diet. 
meat has solutions technology that can provide change better tasting food meatless your reasons are valid too
meatless option lessens methane production lessens runoff in water lessens greenhouse gas emissions meat option meat is difficult to give up
I would tell my friends to purchase organic foods because there is a better chance of having less chemicals in them.
Based on what I head in the videos i would choose the first choice in the first video.Their argument was most relatable and made the most sense

I would tell the that organic farming is the best option because organic farming doesn't use chemical fertilizers, helps with water and soil conservation, and has high nutritional values.  
non-animal source methane production greenhouse gas emissions runoff in water animal source meat is good
I would tell my friends that organic farming might sound appealing at first, but in truth, it is a luxury we as a planet can't afford right now. It is proven that organic farming reacquires a lot more water than regular farming methods utilize. For example, organic milk will take up 80% more land. As stated before, organic products take more water and as droughts become more regular today, it is a resource that we can't waste. Furthermore, organic farming also it makes it difficult for farmers to keep control of the mineral content in the soil because manure is used (pungent odor). If someone was to farm organically, that would mean having to weed crops by hand one at a time. It's not only time consuming, but labor intensive. It said that the food produced by organic farmers is ‰ÛÏa healthier product‰Û, but organic is just another word for expensive. In conclusion, the main question here is, does organic farming have the power to sustain a population of 7.5 billion? The answer is no. Hence, organic farming is not the perfect solution. 


I would tell my friends that organic is the best option because it has no pesticides and no chemicals which is better for us. 
I would tell my friend to go for it, its a good choice and I would even join my friend because anything organic is really good for you.
I would tell my friends that although there is controversy, organic food is the best option. This food maintains biodiversity, contains less pesticides and has no chemicals. This can all impact the body in a very positive way.
First of all, I would tell my friends to keep in mind the pros and cons of both videos, but I think the first one is the best option because you can control your intake of meat and getting others to be aware about their intake can help too. For the second video we don't really know how many farms are using that process.
I'd rather maintain a balanced consumption.
After watching this video I learned how dangerous cow waste was to the environment which i never knew. If cow wastes accounts for 2/ of nitrogenous oxide that means by cutting down our burger consumption w could potentially save a lot of pollution that is caused. So i would have to tell them to go with option 2 because burgers are good sure, but we want the earth to be as happy and healthy as it can be for a long time. 
I would tell them that the best option for them is to watch the videos themselves to form their own opinions of the topic of organic vs non-organic food. 
i believe not eating organic all the time is the best way to go because there is less waste due to not as many bugs damaging food and that also means less forests and land being cleared to farm.
meatless option is better for the environment our bodies 1 meat option meat does contain protein
There are great ideas of sustainability in the second video. I would say all of these options are worth looking into. There are best scenarios in both videos. 
I would tell them i think organic is a great option but sunce were on a budget as college students its probably not the most practical option. 
Based on the information in the video, I would encourage my friends to eat more non-organic food, because while organic foods are theoretically better for the environment and our bodies, it still has negative environmental affects, such as its need for more land, which can lead to deforestation. Also, organic foods can still contain pesticides, which pretty much defeat the purpose of being organic. 
Organic meat is a good choice
I believe it all is best in moderation, since there are also other consequences not explained in these videos to other aspects of the world.
It go organic to be healthy and the benefits of the environment and the long term benefits as well. 
Organic Farms would be the best option because the way animals are treated and how it affects the environment is not that harmful.
meatless option greenhouse gas emissions methane production runoff in water meat option There are some technologies available to counteract pollution.
Organic because uses little to no pesticides, uses no chemicals, and maintains biodiversity.
Organic because it is healthier.
There isn't a better option. They are both reasonable and being debated still for a good reason. When there's a ratio of pro's and con's for both and just as equally good/bad. I am undecided on the topic of organic vs. non-organic. Similarly, scientists can't decided one side or another because while organic food can be good, it can also be bad and lead to worse events. For example, there's more unhealthy gases in the air from organic cows than regular. 
conventional farming is less expensive and it wont cause drought and an excess of methane gas
I think that the word organic makes people think it is better, when in reality it isn't ideal. 
I would tell my friends that conventional farming was better because it yields more food (which we need with a growing population) and it uses less land so we don't have to clear as much vegetation/forests. However, I would say that some changes need to be made to conventional farming such as using pesticides that are less harmful and also cutting down on livestock farming and focusing more on crops.
I would tell my friends that the best option to decrease the pollution is to take the manure from the cows and covert it into sustainable energy that can be used. This method helps create energy safely from the many cows that they milk. Instead of the manure being wasted, it is turned into something beneficial. 
Based on what I heard in the videos, I would encourage my friends to incorporate more organic foods into their diets. It is not feasible, as college students, to completely switch to only purchasing organic foods. Also 

I do see the ways that it positively affects the environment but the pros and cons for the environment and for my personal health seem somewhat balanced. For that reason, I am neither 100% for nor against organic foods and farming.
organic, healthwise. There are less chemicals, pesticides, and GMOs. The fresher and more natural, the healthier.
That all the cow waste and everything else  is hurting our climate.
Conventional because it's cheaper and there isn't a difference in the foods nutritional value and it's not "better for you".
I would say organic foods because with these kinds of foods you are not ingesting harsh chemicals. I would tell them it was worth spending more money because eating healthy makes a difference.
I would choose organic farming because it eliminates the need for pesticides.
I would say the best option is a mixture between orgainc farming and conventional farming because even though organic farming is better for biodiversity, organic farming alone is not practical and would not provide enough for the eight billion people on the planet. 
Organic is the best option because it involves no chemicals, less pesticides and maintains biodiversity
I would say if you can afford to eat organic, then you should.
I would tell them to not be fooled by organic labels, and to remember that different countries have different standards for being "organic." In my opinion, I think that you're just wasting more money by buying organic stuff and that not all things that aren't organic are bad.
I believe that conventional farming is more beneficial to the environment than organic farming, but both methods carry many pros and cons. Even though organic farming minimizes chemical usage by using natural farming methods, improves soil health and promotes biodiversity, it is more expensive and a smaller crop yield is produced. Conventional farming practices utilize chemicals and pesticides to maintain weed and pest control. They also as use GMOs to produce a mass crop yield of produce that has been modified to improve nutrient value, taste, and texture. Conventional farming has worked for many years and seems like the best solution to provide produce for the world's growing population. 
I would tell my friends organic is the best choice but I personally would not pick it.
I believe organic farming is the best option although it is expensive because it is healthier and better for you.
i would tell my friends that organic is a better option for them because of the health benefactors involved with organic food. 
I would tell them that organic foods are better due to the fact there are not as many chemicals used, but to look out and do some research about the organic company first.
I would tell my friend to eat meat because going meatless has to many cons that overweigh the pros.
Organic farming. Even though this method takes more time and land, it is safer for the environment. Humans have to accept the struggles within it and will be able to help better our planet if they use this farming method.
Based on the information provided in the video it was clear that the purpose of the video was to persuade you that organic farming is not only the right method of farming as it was the initial method of farm in the early stages but also econ-friendly because there are no pesticides to harms animals within the field. another premises of the supported claim is that organic farm's good for fighting climate change. with all that information given, i would have to say organic farming is the way to go and i'm all for. 
I would say the best option would be to for my friends would be to try and go meatless and without cheese for one day per week. Thinking realistically, not many of my friends would just up and go vegan or without beef completely. I think incremental changes are best then it doesn't seem so daunting of a task and they might decide that it's something they would like to do long term.
My choice would be organic because there is less pesticides even though there can be some, and no chemicals 
I would recommend organic food because of the pesticides. 
I think organic is best because it isn't filled with all the chemicals, everything is naturally sourced.
I believe organic food is better despite being more expensive. If we continue to buy from large companies who raise their animals in tiny boxes and feed them preservatives, they will continue to treat animals unjustly.  
Meatless  highly effective drastic  timely  1 Meat  it's good and important
Organic because although it is the more expensive option, it is beneficial to human health to eat things closest to the source and allow ourselves for healthier intakes.
both may cause runoff water can create methane fueling transportation made from maneur creative alternatives may be designed 1 either one both contain strong points
To not eat the hamburgers.
Based on what I heard in the videos, I would encourage my friends to incorporate more organic foods into their diets. It is not feasible, as college students, to completely switch to only purchasing organic foods. Also 

I do see the ways that it positively affects the environment but the pros and cons for the environment and for my personal health seem somewhat balanced. For that reason, I am neither 100% for nor against organic foods and farming.
animal source certain innovative solutions greenhouse gas emissions methane production 1 meatless  Yes I can see both sides of the opinion on this matter. Both have valuable lists of pros and cons, however I agree most with the animal source options, because I find it to be the most laid and safe.
I would tell my friends that going meatless is the best option. There are many reasons as to why, cows are the biggest production of methane aka greenhouse gasses. Animal slaughter is also very inhumane and mass done to supply for the demand of meat. 
I would encourage friends to support sustainable farming because I feel that it is important to be mindful of the environment and animal welfare.
Organic farming because it is better for you and better for the animals.
I would go with the first option
I would tell a friend that the best food option is organic because they have more antioxidants and vitamins. These foods are also grown with less pesticides so they are safer and better for your health. 
Already previously explain in pre-survey.
I would tell them to make their own decision, using the materials I just watched. 
They should just buy food separately from now on. Neither of them are right or wrong they can eat the foods that they want to eat regardless of health benefits or cost. 
I would tell my friends that the best option is organic because it is naturally grown and doesn't use chemicals or pesticides which can be harmful to the person consuming it and the environment. Organic is also better for the environment.
I would say the best, most realistic option would be to make our farms more sustainable. However to make an impact on an individual scale, it would be best to cut down on beef consumption.
I believe that if everyone made the effort to reduce their burger intake to one a week, it would help reduce the negative impact on the environment.
With an ever increasing population, it seems as though it would be impossible to completely supply the sustenance for the entire world through organic farming. I think a combination between organic and conventional techniques would need to be utilized in order to preserve our environment while also allowing for enough crop yield to feed the human population. Some conventional farms are able to skyrocket their yields by use of synthetic chemicals, fertilizers, and inhumane means. Unfortunately, this is necessary to a certain extent to feed the overpopulated world. At what cost though? I think certain techniques such as crop rotation, minimization of chemicals, and sustainable practices should be utilized. They should be utilized particularly by the large corporations that produce the majority of the food because of their proportional impact. However, if I am honest, I eat organic foods for a vast majority of my diet due to personal beliefs.
MEAT I enjoy eatting beef it is a family enjoyment i understand the effect it has on the environment etc. 1 meatless of the environment
I would try to tell my friends to try to eat meat and products that are cage free and organic because consuming these products are more beneficial for health and body.
I would say the best option is what ever works best with their lifestyle. I believe both options have their own pros and cons, so the decision is best left to them.
The best option is to go for protein based food. 
The second option!  The system is overall more efficient.  In the first video, it talks of all the waste of normal processes.  In the second video with sustainable farming, everything has its place, there is no waste.
I would tell my friend to go organic and meatless. Going this way is better for the environment, better for your health and better for the animals in the environment. We can sustain ourselves off of plant based organic foods, or just even plant based.
I think that we should stay how we are eating because although organic food has less chemicals it is more expensive and is not practical for a college student budget.
i would say no chemicals because i don't understand it like i think i should. 
meat reduces methane production reduces greenhouse gas emission methane fueling transportation 1 meatless they are different sources of protein and to make room for livestock we must take down forests
I would tell my friend that ultimately it is her decision to make but i would advise her to not eat all organic foods unless she was going to cover the cost of her groceries all on her own. Having everyone split the bill when all of her items were the most expensive would not really be fair to the other two roommates.
Meat sources of protein just because we get better protein through animal protein
i believe the best choice would be to go with the sustainable energy. there will always be meat eaters. it would take a lot of hard work and dedication to switch every meat eater into vegan. but the only option that we have without hurting the environment any more than we already are is to use the resources that we already have. using the methane from cows to power trucks, making it a form of green renewable energy. 
I would probably say that organic foods aren't worth it. Especially on a larger scale, the whole planet would not be able to eat organically since the yield is so low. Plus, they still use pesticides so how organic is it really? 
I would tell my friends that organic farming is the better option. I believe this because less pesticides and chemicals are used on the field and less amount of energy has to be exerted to regulate and maintain the crops
I feel like eating organic is better for you, but depending on their financial place in life maybe they should just keep eating the way they do. 
I would chose conventional farming as both techniques still use pesticides but organic needs more land, causes more methane production from cows, and can feed less people at a higher cost. 
i would tell them to watch the first video because it gives really important facts 
I would tell them to eat organic foods. Organic Foods are a better more natural choice of food for the body. Its more safe to eat and you know what you are consuming.
I would tell my friend to go organic because although it is more expensive it will pay out in the end because of how much healthier it is for the body. 
meat option promote methane fueling transportation create innovative solutions technologies can counteract pollution 2 meatless option we can eat whatever we want as long as there are solutions not to pollute the earth that much
There are pros and cons to each
Sustainable farming because most Americans won't want to make dietary changes.
Buying protein from local farms with no added hormones 
Conventional food is the best option right now because organic food has lower yields, is less efficient, and is more expensive. The world just can't afford the luxury these days.
I believe the ability to use cows as a renewable fuel source is the best option. The majority of Americans will be too reluctant to quit consuming dairy products and cow meat, so it is best to use the cow in a healthy way for the environment.  
Video 2, because it informs the audience about both the good and bad side of organic farming
Meat has higher protein content technologies can counteract pollution creates innovative solutions meatless they want to protect the environment.
I would say that eating organically would be the best option because it is so much better for you and the environment.
I would tell them that they should consider to just stick with the conventional food. The conventional food may not b healthier for you and might have more chemicals or pesticides but it is cheaper and with organic food you can't even know for sure how chemical free it actually is every organic food has different percents. Living in house with two other people you need to consider how much you are affecting everyone in the house with your diet change and how much more we would be spending on grocies.
From what I have heard, I feel that organic food would be the better choice. Considering that they are locally grown and they are better dealt with, organic foods seem like the better choice in my opinion. 
I would chose conventional farming as both techniques still use pesticides but organic needs more land, causes more methane production from cows, and can feed less people at a higher cost. 
Organic farming
organic foods and farming are better for the environment but in a world with a population steadily growing more than it can provide it would be best to stick with conventional foods because it gets the job done fast and easier.
If you are looking at your long term health I would say organic is the better option because youre not consuming as many chemicals or pesticides as you would having non organic foods.
I think choosing to go organic with only the dirty dozen is a good idea for college students. Buying everything organic is difficult because of the expense, but it does ensure that your are not getting anything that you are not supposed to be.
Organic foods because it makes more sense and it keeps you alive longer.
There are pros and cons to each
Organic - better for the environment
I would tell my friends to eat what they like, but to know what they are eating also. 
I would tell my friends to eat more organically because it is beneficial to physical and mental health as well as the environment
I would tell my friends organic foods can be better than non organic. Organic foods are sustainable, better for the environment, and use no chemical pesticides or additives in animals. It can be more expensive and take more work, but the payoff is very beneficial. I think organic farming will grow in popularity once more people realize the health benefits and the benefits for the environment.
Changing our farms so that they reuse the manure produced by the cows is the best solution. That way, Americans can still have as much meat as they want, and the environment isn't getting hurt.
I would tell my friends eating organic food is a good option because it helps our environment. I personally do not eat all organic but I do think it could better most of us. I think its good to not effect the earth with pesticides and to not put as much preservatives in our fruits and vegetables because I think eventually we will see a difference in eating non- organic  foods rather than all organic.
Even though I do not partake in this, I believe purchasing organic foods to be the best option to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Not only is their less chemicals being used to produce the food compared to conventional foods, but organic farming helps fight global warming and support the health and welfare of plants and animals living off the foods that are in the soil.
I would show them the second video because it shows how it may be good to use organic food, but it comes with some cons. Which I feel would show both sides on deciding what type of food to buy.
It would depend on why we are watching the videos. If it was for a class such as digestion or about pollution/methane production then I would chose the first video as it is more factual. If it was for self education, I would watch the second as it is a more interesting piece and not as dry. 
The best option his to think everything through first. 
Conventional, it is cheaper and still has good levels of nutrients 


Organic would be the best option because it not only benefits the environment but also peoples' nutrition. It also has a strong direct impact on employment which is hard for some to find.
Organic farming is better because it does not have any chemicals and is better for the environment.
I would tell them to choose organic foods because although it may not be healthier it is most likely safer
I would probably tell them the un healthy consequences due to red meat, and how much that effects your health and the environment. I would choose to tell them this option because I personally do not eat red meat, and get my proteins through chicken or fish
I would definitely recommend eating organic because it contains fewer pesticides, less preservatives, less antibiotics, growth hormones etc. It is overall healthier 
I think that organic farming is the best option because the products that are produced are better. They do not have chemicals on them, unlike non-organic products.
From long term perspective, I would most likely recommend conventional farming over organic farming due to higher yields/crop, less land required, and ability to control the mineral content of each crops. Although organic sounds pretty, it ultimately is just too much of a hassle financially, physically, and economically to push for a marginal shift into growing them over conventional methods.
to eat meat


Organic because it is more healthy.
Organic farming because of crop and livestock production that involves much more than choosing not to use pesticides, fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones.
The best choice is to eat organic food because it has no chemicals, has less pesticides, and maintains biodeversity.
I'd say that it is important to eat meat (if they're ok with eating meat) every once in a while, but it's more important to break away from this meat-craze America has going on and include healthier variations in our diets.
To eat conventionally as a college student because it is cheaper
Eat no meat or dairy one day a week because that will greatly reduce the production of greenhouse gases.
Being organic is always the best option. Better for humans and better for the environment. 
I would tell my friends to be wary of foods labeled "organic" because the label doesn't necessarily mean "healthier" or "better" for you. The organic farming process does use more natural sources and more environmentally efficient sources however they typically can't afford for an actual FDA organic sticker, but other products that still technically meet organic requirements may refer to themselves as "organic" but really it's ingredients and amounts of things that you want to look at when deciding what foods to buy, not whether they are called organic or not. 
non-animal source is healthier gives off less pollution is more humane meat sources they taste good
i would tell my friends that it would be the best option to buy organic food because it is better for you because it has no pesticides and no chemicals. 
animal source  runoff in water technologies can counteract pollution creating innovative solutions 1 plant based there are alternatives of cow meat, there are alot of pros and cons of eating beef
I would say eating green. Cutting out red meat or even trying to fund snd support farms like Farm Fair Oaks.
non animal source prevents gas eissions methan fuel transportation  runoff in water  1 meat  its full of protein
Conventional meat eating, because it maintains biodiversity, and if eaten organically, doesn't include chemicals.
Even though organic farming has some cons, I would still recommend it to friends because it has more benefits for our bodies and the environment. The popularity of organic farming is still relatively new and I believe the market will find ways to adjust in order to reduce some of the cons mentioned in the video. 
non-animal source reduces greenhouse gas emissions methane production runoff in water 1 animal sources they are a good source of protein
the sustainable farming would be the better option because it uses natural gas and is better for the environment.
In terms of the environment I would tell my friends that the natural process of growing crops is the best option as it has less of an impact on the increase of methane, uses less water, and less land. In terms of health, I would say organic crops are better because they are good for biodiversity within other animals and livelihoods and humans would be consuming less chemicals from crops that would be using pesticides.  
not sure  is neutral and non-biased believe 1 meatless or meat theyalso make sense
yes
I would tell people to start eating less red meat and maybe limit the amount of burgers they are in taking a week. Personally, I do not eat red meat and it makes me feel good knowing that I am not contributing to this greenhouse gas effect in this way. I want others to follow my lead and realize how much we are overproducing cows and destroying our enviornment.
I would tell my friends to choose organic food because it is the easiest for the body to digest and comes from all natural/ non- artificial sources. 
Inorganic foods because it is better for the environment in terms of land. We destroy so much land in order to provide organic foods. 
Non-animal Source Runoff in water Methane production Greenhouse gas emissions no They are causing climate change to get worst
I would tell my friends to purchase organic produce because in the end this is the more natural way to go and i could lead to a healthier life style. I would not want to encourage the factory farms because i do not agree with the way they handle the animals  
meatless option helps the environment helps prevention of the spread of disease there's other protein options for your diet 1 meat option it is affordable
I would tell my friends that although it is more expensive, organic is the way to go. It is healthier with no chemicals and less pesticides
I would still recommend buying more organic than not and choose foods wisely on which companies are not only safer but also what is added to our foods. we can't always eat organic but should be aware of what is in our food
Conventional because I cannot be a hypocrite and it is easier. 
Organic
I would tell my friends that you should go with whatever option makes you happier. Going with the organic option, you will support non-processed agricultural products, and pesticide-free foods which is better for the environment. If you go with the non-organic option, you can still support local farms, but the foods may be more processed and not as healthy. This option is also cheaper. For me, I would still choose non-organic because you can still be a very healthy green eater without going organic.
I can't say I would want to try to sway my friends' thinking one way or another, honestly the best option might be for each of us to purchase the groceries that we want to eat. 
I think organic is the best since if you want to live long and naturally than organic is the best
Meat is meaat.
The best option would be organic farming as it is the most natural way of farming. There are no herbicides, pesticides or fertilizer used. In organic farming manure is used as fertilizer, the farm is weeded instead of sprayed with pesticides, and the ecosystem is healthier with more animals from bees to foxes, making the farming process far more natural and healthy.  
meatless option is healthier for people healthier for the environment it is animal friendly 1 meat option of the proteins and taste
I would tell my friends that organic farming sounds better but has just as many cons - give or take a few - as conventional farming. So choose to eat whatever you want.
First of all, I would tell my friends to keep in mind the pros and cons of both videos, but I think the first one is the best option because you can control your intake of meat and getting others to be aware about their intake can help too. For the second video we don't really know how many farms are using that process.
going meatless because the effect on the environment is detrimental. I would especially agree because I recently attended a Cornell forum where it was stated all the ice in the artic will be melted by 2030 if we continue at the rate we are at
I woud tell my friend that the best option would be organic farming. While it takes much more work and is more difficult than regular farming, organic foods are healthier for humans to consume. These foods have more nutritional value and they are free of GMOs while also not being harmful to the planet. The main con to organic farming would be that is it a lot more expensive, but in the long run I believe organic farming is the better option. 
I believe the best option would be video two because in it, they are taking something that could be harmful to the earth and making it into something green and beneficial. It is almost unrealistic to ask the whole world to stop eating meat like in the first video.
I would tell my friends about both videos, but encourage them to follow the first. I think this would be the best option because this is something they would be able to start immediately and some of us already do it. 
I personally eat organic and from places such as whole foods. I would honestly tell my friends that the best decision is to eat organic as there are fewer chemicals (making it healthier) and maintains biodiversity. 
Sustainable farming. It will have the greatest global impact as well as being important for future generations.
Conventional foods seem to be the more ideal way to eat. Although they are still using pesticides and other harmful chemicals, organic foods do to. They just use a lower dosage or different types of chemicals. You can even say they have loop-hole. Organic foods aren't keeping up with the demanding growth in population, and they are also creating more methane distribution. On top of that they are required to use more land and more water for smaller amounts of portions. Is it even worth the damage to go organic? Is it even considered organic if they are still using chemicals in the food? 
Organic, because the benefits outweigh any negatives
There were claim made by both video that I agree with, but if I had to choose one it would be the second video. I am not a fan of mass production and feeding cows corn just to speed up production and of course profits. With that being said, I am really intrigued by the concept of turning manure into natural gas. I believe it's an innovative idea and I agree with what Gary, the CEO of Fair Oaks Farm stated; "to survive in the 21st century you need sustainability, technology, creativity and innovation" which is true. He's using a great way to turn waste into something productive. 
I would tell my friends to choose the non organic option because to me, it is the better option. Although organic foods are healthier and better for someone, and gives more job opportunities, in the long run, the non organic foods are better for the environment. There is not enough space to grow the organic foods on the earth, especially with the growing population. If we were to make more room for organic farms, we would have to cut down rain forests or something along the lines, which is environmentally bad.  
If they can afford organic definitely go organic because pesticides cann cause cancer.
I would tell my friends to choose sustainability because to survive in the 21st century you're going to need sustainability , creativity, technology, innovation.  It's also a way to avoid the depletion of natural resources and all together is just healthier and better for us.
I would say eating organic foods is a better option. I believe this because when buying organic foods, there is a better chance that the fresh products being bought are not sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals to enhance them. This is not always guaranteed however, the word organic is aiming towards the goal of being all natural and fresh. 
I accidentally skipped ahead when attempting to view video two but I can't go back. I believe everyone is free to make their own choices but I would identify myself as vegan and I would suggest that my friend try going meatless while giving them all the information on why I did so as well as the benefits and let them make an informed decision. 
Based on what I heard in the videos I would tell my friends that both organic and inorganic foods have pros and cons to each. I would encourage them to do research on both. I would personally choose to eat organic foods only and would say that's the best option. I do believe however it really comes down to their personal perspective after educating themselves on the topic. 
I would tell my friends to go organic because there are no chemicals, less pesticides and it also maintains biodiversity among other reasons. Buying organic might not be an option or an option 100% of the time because can be expensive and if it is a meat product like beef, it was more harmful to the environment before processing. Organic can be healthier but it does have its pros and cons.
I would tell them that honestly organic is better for the body because there is less things added to the food making it overall better for you.
I would recommend they stay conventional, regardless of the video. I don't agree with going organic.
The superior option is definitely sustainable farming in my opinion.  It maximizes the product created by cows while minimizing harmful environmental effects.  It would help reduce the damage caused by the meat industry.
I would tell my friends that protein from an animal source is fine as long as there was no added antibiotics or growth hormones because it is a good source of protein, meaning there is a lot more protein in a serving of animal then from puts or seeds.
I would tell my friends about the farm that uses the byproducts of cattle to help cattle survive while producing milk and energy. The video was happy and shorter so naturally, the attention is drawn to that.
I personally believe that an organic lifestyle is best because despite the differences in pricing between organic and conventional, your body will thank you in the long run for the benefits organic foods have.
Conventional foods seem to be the more ideal way to eat. Although they are still using pesticides and other harmful chemicals, organic foods do to. They just use a lower dosage or different types of chemicals. You can even say they have loop-hole. Organic foods aren't keeping up with the demanding growth in population, and they are also creating more methane distribution. On top of that they are required to use more land and more water for smaller amounts of portions. Is it even worth the damage to go organic? Is it even considered organic if they are still using chemicals in the food? 
I will tell them to eat meat if they please too because animals are someone else food chain and you should eat what you enjoy just in moderation.
Meat creates new solutions  technologies counteract pollution runoff in water  1 Meat greenhouse emissions
i would tell my friends eating healthy is very important in anything you do 
I would be a vegetarian because seeing the effects it has on our environment and bodies is disgusting.
I will personally eat organic and I will tell my friends too because it is more natural and safer.
I would tell my friend to eat green, because if the average american actually does eat 3 burgers a week, that is scary, especially because of that rate, we have to feed cows corn which they are not even meant to be eating. 
organic farming is the best choice because no chemicals are used and there are no risks or concerns of getting contaminations. It is also better for you and the environment because of this.
I would say organic is the best option because it's healthier for us. Although organic farmers can still use pesticides, they use less of them.
Organic... same reasons why I do. Already stated.
i wouldn't tell him, so he would have to decide for himself
I would tell my friends to be wary of foods labeled "organic" because the label doesn't necessarily mean "healthier" or "better" for you. The organic farming process does use more natural sources and more environmentally efficient sources however they typically can't afford for an actual FDA organic sticker, but other products that still technically meet organic requirements may refer to themselves as "organic" but really it's ingredients and amounts of things that you want to look at when deciding what foods to buy, not whether they are called organic or not. 
I think conventional farming with organic farming aspects is the best option.
After watching this video I learned how dangerous cow waste was to the environment which i never knew. If cow wastes accounts for 2/ of nitrogenous oxide that means by cutting down our burger consumption w could potentially save a lot of pollution that is caused. So i would have to tell them to go with option 2 because burgers are good sure, but we want the earth to be as happy and healthy as it can be for a long time. 
Based on the videos, the sustainable farming techniques are much more environmentally friendly. The methods they used helped to clean the manure on the farm, while also recycling it for further use. They take more time to ensure the cows they raise will not be as large of a contribution to the greenhouse gases by recycling the manure for more beneficial uses like fertilizer and natural gases.
eat meat because it is a good source of protein
I believe the farm industry CAN primarily use renewable resources and make it better for our environment. However, the second video is only talking about that one location. How many locations that farm actually do all those things to be more green? Also, its very apparent that in our current time, the environment is not a priority to the government right now. It's too expensive and not convenient. So, I agree more with the first video. 
Vegetarianism is the best option. You can get all the nutrients you need without getting harmful side effects and diseases that occur with long term meat eating.
Organic because uses little to no pesticides, uses no chemicals, and maintains biodiversity.
I would tell my friends that the best option is to cut down on using our resources like we have an unlimited supply. We don't have enough resources in the world for every person in the world so we must be responsible when it comes to our Earth and not take it for granted. 
Meat supports farmers allows for technology advancement creates renewable resource options 1 meatless of environmental issues
I wouldn't tell my friends that one is better than the other, I would just inform them about each and the pros/cons that coincide with both sides. So, based on that, I would focus more on the pros that organic faming and eating has. I think a big aspect that attracts organic consumers is the fact there are no chemical and less pesticides used while farming. It is also understandable that the cost factor may limit consumers to choose certain products, but due to the way that organic farmers produce, upkeep and maintain their food, I can see why organic prices would be higher.
If the money is available, organic is the best option. This is true because it uses lest pesticides and chemicals compared to conventional foods. With a lower use of chemicals, it is also helping our environment that is slowly worsening.  
Neither one seems to be better than the other so choose which you think is best. 
I would tell my friends to go organic because there are no chemicals, less pesticides and it also maintains biodiversity among other reasons. Buying organic might not be an option or an option 100% of the time because can be expensive and if it is a meat product like beef, it was more harmful to the environment before processing. Organic can be healthier but it does have its pros and cons.
I'd rather maintain a balanced consumption.
Eating meat, because you get better protein, and it's better to have meat in your diet.


Sustainable farming, obviously. They are able to create clean energy without the addition of contaminate waste.
I'm still undecided 
Based on what I head in the videos i would choose the first choice in the first video.Their argument was most relatable and made the most sense

I would say organic foods are the best option. This is because of the dangerous chemicals that they use to increase the growth rate and yield of the crops. even though they cost more, it is worth it in the end
I would tell my friends that beef is the least of our concerns when we have billions of cars, planes, factories, dumps and ect killing the planet
meat  provides omega 3 acids it is good in taste I am not a vegetable person 1 non-animal sources it contaminates the air
I would not say one is better than the other. I think she should buy some foods organic and some not just to have a good balance. 
Going meatless is a great way to save money and reduce our impact on the environment! 
I think the sustainable farming is the best option. It is the best of both worlds and nothing is wasted.
Avoiding beef as much as possible, but doing what the farm does for what still is produced
the best option is number 2 this is because instead of heavy pollution from the cows and option 1 and now from option 2 than can use the cow manurer and pething gas and producing ways, such as fueling farms and trucks as a fertilizer to better field the land 
meatless option is healthier better for the environment less expensive 1 meat it's good
organic farming because it is less harmful for our environment
I would say conventional farming due to the fact that they  are able to chose between organic fertilizers or conventional. I also thing organic farming is riskier because if they don't use pesticides and other additives the yield won't be enough- therefore there is a 99.9% chance that when you eat organic foods they have been modified.
I think that it would depend on where the organic food is coming from because some organic food may contain more chemicals and pesticides in them than non organic food. However, some farmers use less pesticides on their organic food so their is left pesticide left over. Organic food should be a good choice it is just important to think about the factors and watch what exactly is being eaten. It is also important to keep your location in mind when getting food that might be out of season, or out of the country.
Meat Option creates innovative solutions methane fueling transportation Technologies can counteract pollution 1 meatless runoff in water
Organic has its perks but i believe anybody can eat non organic food and it be okay.
I would tell my friends to eat organic foods. Organic foods are less harmful to the environment in terms of emitting less carbon footprint and is also healthier and better for human consumption.
