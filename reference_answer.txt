Based on the information in the video, I would encourage my friends to eat more non-organic food, because while organic foods are theoretically better for the environment and our bodies, it still has negative environmental affects, such as its need for more land, which can lead to deforestation. Also, organic foods can still contain pesticides, which pretty much defeat the purpose of being organic.
